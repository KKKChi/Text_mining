"SAS/ETS® Forecasting Application Gul Ege, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC Introduction The SAS/ETS® Forecasting application helps you select the best forecasting method and model for your data, using different forecasting methods such as exponential smoothing, ARIMA (Box-Jenkins) models, Winter's smoothing and time·trend regression models. Both interactive forecasting (where the user selects the best model) and completely automated forecasting are available. The Forecasting application creates a default project that stores all your session options, models, and forecasts. You can easily derme other projects. The application displays a list of previously specified models for each series so you can easily scroll between them. In specifying a new model, you can use the default model, modify the current one, copy a model from the list, or let one be selected automatically. The Forecasting application is also capable of storing and deleting both models and forecasts to or from data sets you specify. The forecasting tools you can choose from include: ARIMA models with or without seasonal;tnIerenru.g and/or seasonal autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) factors; exponential smoothing (single, double, or triple); Winter's exponential smoothing (with linear or no trend); linear and quadratic time trend; log transform; and adjustment for seasonality (Xll). Various display and graphics output are available at each step of the forecasting task. You have control over the output at each step and can reset the related options as desired. The period of fit and forecast and the confidence intervals can be adjusted as well. Data exploration features include view of original series; plot of the original, log transformed, and/or differenced series; descriptive statistics; and plots of autocorrelation, inverse autocorrelation, and partial autocorrelation func- tions of the original, log transformed, and/or differenced series.

"x, The usefulness of multivariate statistical process control techniques has been received a tremendous attention. However, the lack of computer tools presents one of the maior obstacles to the acceptance of these techniques. A macro is thus developed to provide two control charts: the multivariate exponentially weighted moving average control chart and the log lSI control chart. These control charts constitute a multivariate analog of univariate control charts and are useful in detecting small process mean shifts and process dispersions where respectively. Some case studies under linear mean trend shift and covariance expansion situations are given to demonstrate the performance of the control charts.",Sugi-91-111 Chua.txt

SAS Informats to read them. IBM Internal Data Formats decimal, and packed decimal. Here is a brief Six data formats are cammaniy used on IBM description of each of them: mainframes: character, binary, floating paint, zoned Description Name Character fields are stared as characters - their contents are usually letters, numerals, Character or punctuation, They can usually be displayed on a terminal or printer. The $111 or $CHARIII informat is usually used to read this data type. A charoder field in which only numeric characters (0-9, decimal point, and minus sign) Numeric Character are stared. This is not really a separate data type, but a subset of the character type. It is the format in which data entry is usually dane. The w.o' inform at is usually used to read this data type. Binary numbers, which are always stored as integers, are stored in ""bose 2"". Each bit Binary has a particular value. You can think of it as being stored as a series of 1's and O's. They usually aren't printable, and very few people can read them, even in hexadecimal format, and know what values they represent. The IBlllo' or PIBlllo' infarmat is usually used to read this data type. Floating Paint Floating paint numbers can be integers or fractions. A floating point number is stared in twa parts, like a number in scientific formut. The left port contains a power of 2 by which the right half is multiplied to get the real value. Floating point numbers can be much larger or smaller than binary numbers an IBM systems, but they can cause rounding error. Numeric SAS variables are stored in floating point.

"First Place Best Presentation of Data - Color Patrice Dor City of Montreal Maps with proportional circles were used in order to underline the importance of hospital centers in terms of the number of admissions for 1988-89 in the downtown area of Montreal. This way of representing such data proved to be really efficient to derme the impact area of most of the major centers for the selected zone. Based on the display, it then became possible to sketch a fairly good profile of the health system provided throughout the region as well as identify probable flaws. The code that generated the output is composed of three separate programs. The first two programs are built mainly with a series of Annotate datasets followed by two GMAP procedures; one for the main map and one for the ""close-up"". The third program is a Data Step Graphics Interface that displays both maps within a single output. Various Annotate datasets were needed to generate the wanted features: - Legend (text and proportional circles) - Circles (inside) - Circles (contour lines) - Centre of circles (hospital location) - Seale, orientation, titles and comments. One of the problems encountered was superposing the circles without loosing their respective contour lines. This was achieved by using two different Annotate datasets (""CERCLEl"" and ""CERCLE2""). One drew the inside of the circle using a chosen color while the other re-drew the contour line in the color used for the background of the map, forcing the edge of the circles to stay apparent. The source data for this study was grouped into classes which were assigned a respective circle diameter. Then, the circles were drawn against the background of the downtown area of Montreal which was divided into DSC l(""Departement de Sante Communautaire"") and CLSC l(""Centre Local de Services Communautaires"") regions used by the Health Department.

"FirslPlace Best Presentation of Data - Monochrome Paul Fingerman Boeing Computer Services In the treatment of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), close communication between the patient and his or her physician is critical to the effective diagnosis and treatment of the disease. Since IBD is incurable, and is treated by medical management of symptoms, it is crucial for the physician to understand accurately the condition of the patient. Unfortunately, there is only a modicum of information available from tradition- al laboratory tests. Instead, the careful reporting of symptoms by the patient on a regular basis guides the physician in the selection of medications and the adjustment of dosages. In the present case, the patient kept a daily diary in which he recorded the time of every bowel movement, the quality of the stool (normal to liquid diarrhea on a four- point scale), and the amount of blood in the stool (on a four-point scale). In addition to these quantitative measures, the patient also recorded verbal descriptions of other significant symptoms (tenesmus, cramps, passage of mucous, etc.). The patient entered the diary entries into a SAS data set using a SAS/FSP screen (see attached). The attached graphic was later produced by the attached SAS program. The graphic allowed the physician to examine simultaneously the details of the patient's recent history, including the verbal comments, as well as the long-term trends of the quantitative measures. The physician felt that this significantly enhanced his understanding of the patient's condition, as compared to other patients who merely provided oral summaries. The upper half of the graph was generated using GPLOT to overlay the three quantitative measures, and an ANNOTATE data set to add the verbal comments for each day of the month. The lower half was generated by computing five-day moving averages for each of the quantitative measures, and using essentially the same GPLOT program to present six-months worth of",Sugi-91-295 Fingerman.txt
"First Place Most Creative Software - Color Perry walts Fox Chase Cancer Center A STATISTICAL MODEL FOR CLONAL PROLIFERATION ""Left Branch"" Tree Synthesis of Randomly Dividing Cells Alive at a Fixed Time Horizon InteIpretation of clinical or biological data often requires an underlying mathematical or statistical model. Such models increase the power of experiments to confirm or refute precisely stated hypotheses, but they often require visual displays to explain their construction. The model that inspired this graphics display attempts to determine the effects of somatic cell mutation and selection on immune cells that are collected many cell divisions after the onset of infection. The simulation starts with an unmutated ancestral cell. Each cell is succeeded by a left and a right daughter and each lineage is continued for a predetermined length of time. Cells can mutate or remain the same. Mutations either cause death or change the generation time of a mutant's successors. In a real life situation a complete tree of cells dividing every 18 hours would contain nearly 300 million cells at 21 days; a computational nightmare. This is where the ""left branch"" algorithm comes into play. With this algorithm, each lineage is examined by following a complete line of left descendents to the cell that crosses the time horizon. Once information is collected, the lineage of cells can be discarded, and processing continues by next examining the lineage of the right daughter of the cell's immediate ances[Or. If a cell dies, no information is collected. By systematically examining and discarding information s[Orage is limited to the length of the current lineage from ances[Or [0 horizon.

Ames Plantation maintains records on the number of coveys of quail found, as well as the number of dogs running in the trial. The field trials include both a Morning course and an Afternoon course. This graph, which is updated yearly for the Superintendent of Ames Plantation, attempts to show that the number of coveys runs in cycles. It also strives to compare the two courses. Consequently, this graph does not attempt to assign causes to the fluctuation in coveys, but merely identify the different cycles. ® This graph was generated using the Beta Test version of SAS for OS/2, using the HPWS2 device driver. PROC GPLOT created the basic graph. Options on the LEGEND statement positioned the legend in the upper left corner of the graph, and add a drop shadow on the legend box. The laser jet tended to cut off the left portion of the graph; therefore several steps had to be taken to correct this problem. For example, the NOTE statement (with the MOVE option) created the line at the bottorn of the graph instead of the FOOTNOTE statement. NOTE statements were also used to create the vertical axis label. PROC GFONT created the dog and bird symbols used to plot the data values from datasets outlining the characters. PROC GFONT was invoked twice, as I wanted the dog to be empty, while I wanted the bird to be filled. Having both characters filled tended to give the graph a messy appearance.

Using the label function from the annotate facility one can create pictures, diagrams, and many other embellishments to customize graphics output from SAS/GRAPH or to use as stand-alone displays. SAS 6.06 Man was created to make a comment on the current state of the new SAS release and as an exercise in the use of the annotate facility. The program was developed using PC SAS 6.04 on a 286 clone. The output was created using the APLPLUS driver to output a postscript graphics stream file which was printed on an Apple Laserwriter NTX. In the Annotate facility it is easiest to work when the cell size matches the smallest unit of the preview device, and thus lets you specify all integer values. The previews of this program were done using an EGA graphics card with HPOS=640 and VPOS=350, the resolution of the EGA display. The final coordinates are translated in the program to match the correct output device values. PC SAS was used over the logical choice of 6.06 due to hardware configurations limitations at our site. I see no reason why the program would not run under 6.06 with only minor site-specific modifications to the goptions; but based on all the strange things I have seen happen in 6.06 I wouldn't bet money on it. 1642 Faster than a speeding COBOL program?

For capacity-constrained PC users, the micro-to-host link provides a significant benefit: the ability to manage large SAS datasets on the host, and selectively process small subsets of this data on the PC. This strategy takes full advantage of the host system's capacity and the interactive environment of the PC. However, there are performance considerations when using this distributed processing architecture. First, depending on the communications con- figuration, it may be impractical to ship SAS source code, SAS datasets, and other files between the PC and host system.

Release 6.06 was indeed more flexible and powerful than Version 5, but it was not as fast. The goal of Release 6.07 of the SAS System was improved perior- mance. Release 6.07 refines the powerful system introduced in Release 6.06 so that it is as fast as or faster than Version 5; that is, Release 6.07 provides all the power and flexibility of Release 6.06 without sacrificing performance.

It also addresses the problem in large UNIX environments of data overload, by recommending a specific set of key indicators to retain, as well as what UNIX as and network resource usage levels to use for exception reporting. The recommendations are based on the experiences of working in Northwest Airlines' large, highly integrated UNIX environment used for the processing of several important IS business applications. The solution implemented at Northwest Airlines was to loosely couple a UNIX based, SNMP compliant, resource usage and event monitoring software package, and a network monitoring software package with the UNIX version of SAS.

"First Place Best Presentation of Data - Color Perry Watts Fox Chase Cancer Center Shannon (H) Measure of Amino Acid Diversity with 95% Confidence Bounds Superimposed on the Ca. Backbone Structure of the Mouse VK Gene Immunologists are studying the relationship between an antibody's physical structure and the amino acid sequence diversity of its component residues. While the association between structure and diversity is far from understood, the enclosed graphic supplies some supporting evidence for its existence. ReSidues represented by circular discs tend to be grouped by hue, and a higher measure of diversity is seen at the periphery of the structure where there is greater exposure to the host environment. PROC G3D is used with the SCATIER statement to draw a molecular disc and stick model of the antibody structure. A numbered legend attached to eight hues clearly demarcates cut-off points for the diversity measure. DOT and CIRCLE symbols from an ANNOTATE data set are used to shade and outline concentric circles that represent the diveristy measure with 95% confidence bounds. Vectors are needed for determining a residue's distance from the origin. Distance must be calibrated so that discs and connecting lines are plotted in the proper order with the view of more distant residues being appropriately blocked by closer ones. Coincidentally, depth is heightened by diminishing disc size and the thickness of connecting lines as distance increases. This particular display shows that PROC G3D can be used for other applications besides needle, scatter or surface plots. 1512  Shannon (H) Measure of Amino Acid Diversity with 95% Confidence Bounds Superimposed on the Ccx Backbone Structure of the Mouse VK Gene Diversity Scale + 1.96s H .0.00-<0.32 · 0.32-<0.65 ...

"First Place Best Presentation of Data - Monochrome Richard L. Berg The Cleveland Clinic Foundation The two-dimensional scatter plot is one of the simplest and yet most useful tools for investigating and displaying data. Scatter plots are particularly helpful in presenting data from longitudinal studies, where there is interest in changes from one time point to another, and from paired experiments, where differences are of particular interest. The SAS program below uses PROC GPLOT to produce a scatter plot and provides two SAS macros which can be used to enhance the basic plot through the ANNOTATE facility. The first macro generates box plots for the X and Y variables along the axes. The second macro highlights the differences by adding a (Y X) difference scale which includes a box plot for the differences. All three box plots display a box for the quartiles, whiskers out to the 5th and 95th percentiles, the mean, the minimum, and the maximum. The program output is illustrated with data on energy intake from the feasibility phase of the NIH funded Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study (Kopple et aI, 1989). The graphic supplements the visual impression of the data available in a simple scatter plot by illustrating summary statistics for both variables and the difference. The graphic clearly illustrates the magnitude of the differences and shows that, on average, observed intakes were 5 kcal/kg below prescribed intakes. Kopple, J. D., R. Berg, H. Houser, T.

In particular, displaying these language elements of the text helps to highlight usage patterns both of the language and the author. History The data and general techniques are based on work done by Edward A. Robson for a dissertation in linguistics at Syracuse University during the 1970s. He has continued the work as a personal research project; I became involved in 1990 to help with SAS programming and output design. Data The data used to create the graphs has one observation for each word in the text. Each observation currently has variables indicating chapter, word number (consecutively numbered from chapter beginning), part of speech, verb tense (if applicable), preposition information (if applicable: preposition, case, and prepositional phrase duration), and relative clause information (similar to prepositional phrase). The data structure has evolved and grown over time; other items may be added in the future. For simplicity, numbers are used to represent the information, although the value assigned has little or no meaning. Frequencies are generated to find data item distributions, although they are not the primary output of the analysis.

"olina Abstract The project management procedures in SASjOR@ software have been growing in scope con- tinuously over the years. The first part of this paper briefly lists some of the new options that are available in the CPM, GANTT, and NETDRAW procedures. The major focus of the paper, however, is to describe and illustrate some of the more advanced scheduling features of the CPM pro~edure. The CPM procedure allows you to specify target dates, save baseline dates, update a project that is in progress, schedule subject to scarce resources, and perform several scheduling tasks. Each of these features of the procedure can be fine tuned according to your needs using the options available. To effectively use any project management system, it is essential to understand the heart of the system; in particular} you need to understand how all the scheduling options work together. New Features Several new options have been added in Release 6.07 (SAS Institute Inc., 1992). Some of the highlights are · logic Gantt chart · time scaled and zoned network diagram · alternate resources in PROC CPM · baseline schedules · lag calendars · activity delay Software Scheduling Project Consider a simple project in a software development department.

Figure 2 is an example of an unclassed Traditionally choropleth maps of continuous data are produced by first grouping the values of the variable to be mapped into a small choropleth map using the same data used to pr()duce the maps in number of class intervals. Shading is then applied to each Figure 1. The unclassed method therefore provides solutions for geographical area of the map according to the class assigned to three major problems associated with choroplethic mapping: first.

"Although objective achievement tests lend themselves to machine scoring, educators and programmers have not fully exploited the possibilities. Alternative methods of presenting and scoring objective tests are reviewed and those worthy of further research are identHied. Reliability, the reproducibility of measurements when testing conditions remain constant, is a prime requirement. In general, the longer the test and the less prone it is to random guessing, the more reliable. For objective tests guessing is related to the number of alternative answers. Because testing time is limited, a trade-off is necessary between a long test with few alternative answers per question and a test with fewer questions but more alternatives. Commonly, tests require the student to 'choose the single best answer provided'. However, it is demonstrated that the probability of a correct guess is typically lower when the test instructions require more than one answer to be selected. Theoretically, such tests are expected to show higher reliability than conventional ones. Whether this expectation is supported is a matter for empirical research. The SAS programming required to implement these innovations is discussed.",Sugi-93-157 Klein Emslie.txt

"First Place Best Presentation of Data Deb Cassidy Columbus, OH IDENTIFYING SALES REGIONS USING PROC GMAP A company had a list of potential customers and needed to determine where the sales representatives should concentrate their efforts. Frequencies on state and zip code provided some information. However, there was no easy way to know which zip codes were in the same area. Using frequencies also assumes the reps are assigned by state. Another problem arose because some cities are on state borders and should be serv~d by a sales rep in another state. For example, the Cincinnati metropolitan area actually includes cities in Ohio, Kentucky, and Indiana. Other states, such as Pennsylvania, are so large that they should be separated into two areas. One thing frequencies do not show are limitations in the data such as a lack of potential customers in a major metropolitan area. PROC GMAP was the solution. One of the map datasets shows counties within states. SAS Institute offers a dataset which matches zip codes to counties. The number of potential customers per county is then graphed. The frequencies run earlier determined which states would be graphed. Red was used for definite target areas, blue for secondary areas, and yellow for tertiary areas. Counties without potential customers were left blank. An annotate dataset is used to print names of major cities as reference points. GMAP permits you to specify minimum and maximum values for latitude and longi tude. This feature enabled graphs to show customers ""across the border"" without shOwing the entire state. Values were specified slightly higher and lower than the values for the individual state. Surrounding states are separated from the main state so each state can be easily identified. This graph could be modified to include several states. However, an attempt to do the entire US exceeded the capacity of the mainframe.

"Top Award (People's Choice) · Aesthetics/Artistry Susan J. Kenny Division of Diabetes Translation In the 1970's, a German researcher, Harald Kueppers, developed the basic law of color theory, a concept which unified the physics of color with the biology of human color vision. With this theory, the entire color spectrum Is expressed as the combination of percentages of each of three primary colors. Kueppers chose to Illustrate this theory by using a chromatic hexagon, with each of the vertices representing one of six basic colors. Migration around the hexagon produces combinations of the basic colors whlla movement towards the center of the hexagon produces a slow gradient to either black or white. This graphic Is an illustration of a color hexagon that has been extended to produce a color cube. The basic law of color theory lends itself naturally to hexadecimal color expression. Using an array of hexldecimal values, each Individual color was created as a combination of hexldecimal values In the form of CXRRGGBB.

Realising this phenomena, the need to develop an analysis system seems appropriate - as this system would efficiently assists decision makers in solving certain pertinent issues. This paper discusses the development of such system based on pre existing information system. SAS procedures like SAS Base, FSP, AF, STAT, ETS and GRAPH are used. The case study chosen for the development of this system is one of the largest and most active social organisation in Malaysia and the software used by this organisation to keep important information is dBaseIV.

This paper shows how the idea of such a system was born in our company. what we did to develop it and in which way it improved the daily work of our managers. 1. Introduction db Life Insurance was founded 1989 as a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest banking establishment. It employs over 300 people. The headquarter is located in Wiesbaden, Germany. With inn~vative life insurance products it was growing rapidly. Righ~ from the beginning ourcompany was amongst the TOP}O in selling new busi,ness. Although we sell regular types of life insurances our particular know how is focused on 'one-shop-shopping' which in our case is the connection of bank and insurance business services:' For that reason db Life Insurance is an important partner of the Deutsche Bank group in questi9ns of old-age-protection and family provision. . . ,. The marketing network of db Life Insurance consists of four main distributive channels (see diagram 1). Of course, the Deutsche Bank branches are the most important. But our products are also selled through other subsidiaries of Deutsche Bank. through competent insurance brokers as well as employees of db Life Insurance. 319 2. Why we developed VIPAS ? Our managers allover the branches of Deutsche Bank but also in the headquarter need actual information to lead our business successfully. It is very important for them to get a fast overview of the current situation and to recognize an out-of-line situation as early as possible.

"rief survey of time series forecasting tools in the SAS Sys- tem, principally in SAS/ETS® software. INTRODUCTION There are many things you might want to forecast. This paper dis- cusses time series forecasting. By time series forecasting we mean that you have something that is measured regularly over time and want to predict the value at future time periods. An example is forecasting the monthly sales of some product. An- other example is forecasting gross national product measured quarterly. Time series forecasting methods include judgmental methods, This tutorial paper focuses on SAS/ETS procedures and gives little structural models, and time series methods. attention to the forecasting menu system. However, keep in mind that there is an easier way to use these methods. Judgmental methods make use of personal opinions and judge- ments. The problems with judgmental methods are subjectivity and Time series forecasting methods often are based on statistical time poor accuracy in practice. series models. You fit a statistical model to the time series process and then use the model to generate forecasts. Structural models use independent variables to predict dependent variables.

"the American National Standards Institute (ANSI). In its current form, PROC SQL provides many features available in the DATA step and the MEANS, PRINT, and SORT procedures. An advantage of using PROC SQL is that it can often result in fewer and shorter statements than using existing DATA step and procedure methods. This hands-on workshop illustrates numerous examples of how PROC SQL and its many statements can be used. In particular, participants will learn how to create and modify tables and views, retrieve data using the SELEcr statement, and perform efficient queries against SAS System data sets. Brief History of Structured Query Language (SQL) Structured Query Language (SQL) has an interesting history: It is a universal language that was developed to easily access data that is stored in relational databases or tables. A relation is represented as a two-dimensional table consisting of rows and columns. A series of guidelines were developed by Dr. E. F. Codd, an ffiM mathematician, through the use of relational mathematics. SQL evolved over time to access data regardless of the application software (e.g., COBOL, PI./l, etc.) being used. Basic SQL Concepts SQL boasts the ability to define, manipulate, and control relational databases or tables as well as providing easy user access. The concept behind SQL is that the user does not have to specify physical attributes about the data such as data structure, location, and/or data type.

"o Company ABSTRACf The popularity of the use of crossover designs in clinical pharmacology research and experimentation has increased in recent years. This rise in popularity has motivated analysts and researchers alike to search for the simplest method with which to correctly analyze data from such experiments. When carryover effects are introduced into a model that contains random effects, the GLM procedure of SAS® fails to provide an adequate analysis. This paper demonstrates the use of the MIXED procedure of SAS® to properly analyze data from a crossover design with three treatments and three periods.

"Small-Sample Inference in SASs Software: Using Exact Methods Cyrus R. Mehta Cytel Software Corporation, Cambridge, MA 1 Introduction Exact tests (or randomization tests as they are sometimes called), are a way to obtain exact p·values or confidence intervals without making any large-sample or parametric assumptions about the data. Thus they provide valid inferences for popular hypothesis tests like the Pearson chi·squared test or the likelihood ratio chi-squared test, even when most statistical packages print out a warning that ""the results may not be valid because some of the cell counts in the observed contingency table are small"". The method of inference is conceptually simple and may be viewed as a straight· forward extension of Fisher's exact test for the 2 x 2 table. The hard part is doing the computations. However, the recent development of fast numerical algorithms combined with the rapid advances in computer technology have made it feasible to run exact tests routinely. The StatXact package (Cytel Software Corporation, 1991) provides exact tests and exact confidence intervals for a broad class of nonparametric problems, including one, two, and k-sample problems, ordered or unordered r x c contingency tables, and stratified 2 x c contingency tables. In the pharmaceutical industry, StatXact is typically. used as a stand-alone package in interactive mode to check the validity of p.values produced by SAS on suspiciously small data sets. There are no tools to interface StatXact with SAS for large production runs in which hundreds of tables are analysed in batch mode and the output submitted as part of a medical report. This is a serious deficiency, for it inhibits the routine use of StatXact. Data can change at the last minute as corrections or omissions are rectified. When that happens the batch· mode SAS production run is usually repeated. But the interactive StatXact spot-checks on small contingency tables may not be repeated for lack of time and resources.",Sugi-94-204 Mehta.txt

"ABSTRACT The SAse Screen Control Language Source-Level Debugger is a MUST for developing SASlAF"" applications. This presentation will cover using system return codes, system messages, and the debugger to debug code. The debugger is a powerful utility that allows stepping through an executing SCL program, examining or monitOring values of SCL variables, checking program flow and logic, bypassing groups of statements, displaying arguments passed to a called program, and changing values of SCL variables during execution. Tips on how to use the debugger when testing a series of nested programs will also be discussed. INTRODUCTION In the early days of programming, programmers placed numerous 'PUT"" statements in the source code of misbehaved programs in order to trace the program flow and examine the value of variables to find the error(s). It usually took many iterations of placing 'PUTS' in the source code, recompiling, and testing the program to find the cause of the misbehavior, or better known as the ""bug'. Then the bug had to be fixed, the PUT statements removed, and the program recompiled. This is the 90's! You can throw out those 'PUT' statements. With the SCL debugger, you compile only ONCE with the Debug option on, and then interactively, you trace the program flow, examine the values of variables, set up breakpoints and variables to be watched, alter the value of variables, and more. There is no compiling over and over and no removing a multitude of 'PUT"" statements from",Sugi-94-249 Julian Barnes.txt

"Introduction to FRAME Entries in SASIAP Software John C.

As the user interacts with the application, the application can customize and execute SAS source code interactively. noninteractively, or even on a remote machine. other source programs such as Basic, Fortran, Cobol, and PUI can also be customized and submitted for execution from the application. Prior to the introduction of the FRAME entry, entries within a SASIAF application could not easily intermix text and graphics. As a result, SAS/AF-entries did not take on a graphical user interface appearance. The FRAME entry, available in Release 6.08 and subsequent releases, supports the intermixing of text and graphics. As a result, SASIAF applications can now take on a graphical user interface appearance. Display 2 .

Nelson University Computing and Networking Services The University of Georgia SAS and SAs/GRAPH are trademarks of SAS Institute, Inc. Other brand and product names are registered trademarks or trademarks of their respective companies. Introduction SAS/GRAPH can be a challenge when you want to use it for producing charts and plots for everyday use. This hands-on workshop is for users who want to produce high-quality presentation graphics without a lot of time and energy spent on learning the entire SAS System for Graphics. You will learn how to set up the graphics environment, create basic charts and plots, enhance them, and manage the graphics output. Using examples provided, participants will learn how to use SAS/GRAPH, including syntax conventions for using SAS on MVS, CMS, UNIX, OS/2, Windows, and DOS. Although most examples will use LIB NAME's and FILENAME's for the PC environments, all other examples will be host independent. Scope of the Workshop We will work through two examples of taking data from a conceptual, 'raw' form to final form. We will also show an example of taking a graphic produced with SAS and saving it in a form that can then be used with other software packages. SAS/Graph Software Under Various Operating Systems This workshop was designed using SAS for Windows 3.1. Most of the conventions described in the lessons below, will apply to versions of SAS at version 6.04 and higher. 373 Overview of the Capabilities of SAS/GRAPH The SAS System for Graphics (specifically, SAS/GRAPH) contains numerous procedures allowing for a wide range of graphics capabilities within SAS Software.

"MACROS AND FUNCTIONS I~ C AND SASe SOFTWARE Lillian L. Randolph, Ph.D. American Medical Association Chicago, Illinois ABSTRACT: Macros and functions are procedures which offer pro- grammers both advantages and disadvantages in writing efficient and understandab~e code. Some advantages are cammon to both procedures, while others result from either the one or the other. In C c~ared to BAS software, programmers have a greater freedom to define macros and functions, although both procedures are p~entifu~ in both ~anguages. Therefore, understanding the contributions of macros and functions can ~ead to rationa~ choices in programming and to overa~~ better code. 394  MACROS AND FUNCTIONS IN C AND SAS@ SOFTWARE Programs written in C or SAS can be compiled and executed on every- thing from small personal computers to powerful workstations (linked arnot in networks) to large mainframes. Both languages are ""portable"", meaning that programs written in these languages can be compiled and executed in any of several systems as long as the required compiler type (i.e., for C or SAS) is available on the system. What counts is the availability of the appropriate compi- ler, not the size of the system. In C and SAS, macros and functions have a similar definition and a similar usefulness. Macros result in macro expansion, replacing the macro call with its replacement text and the macro parameters with its arguments. Thus, their usefulness is to save the pro- grammer from writing the code in the macro expansion. Functions return a value from one or more arguments. We might create functions by naming the function and specifying its parameters (and, in C, the data type that the function returns). Their usefulness is to define a procedure which is always done in the function call, the protocols of execution, and the result of executing the procedure. Macros and functions are examples of modularization, the division of programs into small structures, each performing a single task. Modular",Sugi-94-73 Randolph.txt

"From the Ridiculous to the Sublime: Getting Files from There to Here Robert H. Upson - Virginia Community College System Gail M. Barnes - Southside Virginia Communhy College Tamara R. Fischell - Timely Technical Solutions Introduction: Determining the procedures that successfully transport SAS datasets across different hardware platforms assumes critical importance as sites move further from single-vendor, single protocol systems. And, although SAS Institute's Multi-Vendor-Architecture, as impressive as it is, attempts to address many of these problems, it does not eliminate the difficulties you will encounter in transporting remote-stored data across different environments. There are a number of good reasons to become familiar with SAS transport files, and to learn how to get them from one place to another. Data and applications can be created and can reside at the most appropriate location, as long as you know how to transport them when they are needed. The large resource investment needed to rekey, reproof, and recode data that are already available is eliminated if you can move the data at will. And finally, in this multi-protocol world, SAS transport files are just ONE example of the utility of being able to move proprietary format files as needed. Other analogous applications include text (Le., PostScript, Word-Perfect) and executable (Le., public domain programs) that you may transport without (much) trepidation. This paper briefly describes SASjCONNECT, offers several alternative methods if SAS jCONNECT is not available, and suggests how you might select the method most likely to guarantee data integrity. But First, Some Definitions: In order to better understand the process, and select the best method of file transfer, it is necessary to understand the relationship between the hardware and software used in the transfer process.

Introduction 'Wind rose"" is a USAF Environmental Technical Application Center (USAFETAC) program that creates a graphic representation of the average wind speeds and directions, and the frequencies of their occurrence for a given site.

In early 1991, the graphics generation routine was being handled by PROC ANNOTATE, and only printed one graph for the surface winds per site. A request for customer specified heights was recieved. resulting in multiple graphs per site, which meant major changes in the code. After reviewing the options, it was determined that the SAS Datastep Graphics Interface (DSGI) would be the best graphics generation method, since it allows the creation of graphics from within the data step, something not possible with the Annotate facility.

"USE OF THE DYNAMIC DATA EXCHANGE (DOE) FOR DATA TRANSFER BETWEEN SAS (Versions 6.08 and 6.10 under Windows) AND EXCEL SUGI95 DidierCROS LINCOLN SYSTEMS The arrival of SAS System under Windows (v 6.08) ushers in new features for users of SAS information delivery solutions. The integration of SAS applications with Windows inevitably leads to interactive links between SAS and the various standard software packages commonly employed by users (EXCEL, LOTUS, etc). To satisfy this increasing demand of communications, it is important to gain a clear understanding of the interactive relations between SAS Information Delivery System and the Windows system. The SAS System is an open system and as such provides tools to connect to any applications thru various different ways. DOE or OLE are good examples under Windows. After a brief survey of the DOE facility, this report discusses the transfer of SAS tables to EXCEL ant the transfer of EXCEL tables to SAS.

"Comments and Special Characters Deb Cassidy Computer Horizons Corporation The idea for this paper came about because a coworker added macro comments to a macro and it stopped working. No one could see anything wrong with the comments and she thought the only unusual thing she added was an underscore. She inserted 1* before the flIst comment and 'I after the last comment so the entire set of macro comments was treated as one large comment. This solved the problem. A few days later, the same thing happened to someone else. The second time the problem was more obvious. A single quote was within the macro comment. However, it was being used as an apostrophe. Quotes and apostrophes are different in the English language but not in the SAS® language. The preferred solution in this case was to simply drop the apostrophe. Two single quotes could have been used or the 1* *1 could have been left in the comments. The apostrophe does not cause a problem in base SAS but it does when using the macro language. The difference is that everything is treated as text in the macro language sO SAS actually ""looks"" at the comments. In base SAS, any text found between the beginning and the end of the comment is ""ignored"". However, even if you are not using macros you might have problems when the ""end"" of your comment isn't where you think it is. The next page shows what happens when you put certain types of text into a comment. I've included sample error messages when it doesn't work. In base SAS, you can write comments in the forms: * comment; I' comment 'I (Caution to MVS batch users: don't put the I' in columns 1-2.)

"Introduction to FRAME Entries in SAS/AF® Software John C. Boling, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC INTRODUCTION SAS/AF software, announced in 1985, is an application facility for building interactive enterprise information systems. As the user interacts with the application, the application can customize and execute SAS source cod~ interactively, noninteractively, or even on a remote machine. Other source programs such as Basic, Fortran, Cobol, and PUI can also be customized and submitted for execution from the application. Prior to the introduction of the FRAME entry, entries within a SAS/AF application could not easily intermix text and graphics. As a result, SAS/AF entries did not take on a graphical user interface appearance. The FRAME entry, available in Release 6.08 and subsequent releases, supports the intermixing of text and graphics. As a result, SAS/AF applications can now take on a graphical user interface appearance. Display 2 Example FRAME Entry GRAPHICAL USER INTERFACES OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING TERMS Graphical User Interfaces are multi-window, graphic-oriented user applications. Typically, they contain window elements such as FRAME entriestake advantage of object-oriented concepts, the bit-mapped and structured graphics, icons, pull-down and pop-up latest development in programming and interface techniques.

"Applications Development Screen Design For Frame Entries Don Stanley Information Power Limited WeUington NEW ZEALAND Overview ""An application interface should be visually, conceptually, and linguistically clear. Visual.lements should be immediately comprehensible, ideally because they relate to real-world analogues, and should be arranged so that their fundions are comprehensible. Conceptual metaphors should be simple and realistic. Interface text sbould be clear, unambiguous, and free of jargon"". The preceding statement from Microsoft is an excellent comment on the ideal GUI interface. To try and achieve this, this paper presents some ideas for designing screens used with Frame applications. The ideas presented bere are a combination of tried and tested techniques, and my own ideas that I have found work.

"esticides and Toxic Substances, Office of Pesticide Programs has been given the task of reviewing chemical registrant data and analyses some of which use the statistical technique of ridits~ The technique of ridit analysis used in severity analysis was studied for its feasibility for use at the EPA. The two data sets chosen were that of one study evaluating the severity of glomerulonephropathy in male rat kidneys with dose increments of the chemical being reviewed and another of mononuclear cell leukemia,_ also in male rats. Introduction. This is in response to a request for computer validation of a ridit analysis done by hand. A generic SAS program to calculate the ridits t mean ridits by group, the overall population mean ridit and a chi-square statistic to test hypotheses of no dose difference with respect to the control dose was developed for use with multiple dose levels. The reference group was the population although the control group can also be specified. Two data sets were examined. The evaluation of severity of glomerulonephrophy in male rat kidneys with dose increments of the pesticide X and a second evaluation of severity of mononuclear cell leukemia with dose increments of the pesticide Y were reported.

"Applications Development Using Lists To Replace Formats In SeL Applications Don Stanley Information Power Wellington NEW ZEALAND OVERVIEW This paper shows how some SeL applications that use SAS user defined formats can be enhanced by changing from using formats to lists. Often, we use formats in an seL application simply because that is what we used in SAS data and proc step coding. We know and understand user defined formats from our base SAS use. However, in SeL applications, formats may not be appropriate for optimal performance. REVIEW OF FDUtA7t Little control over contents from seL (1) In order to alter the format you must submit code (2) No control over removal from memory Once a format is loaded it is up to SAS internal mechanisms as to when the format is removed (3) No ability to add to without re-building entire format You may load a very large format, then need to add an item (perhaps by allowing a user to add to an underlying dataset from which the format is sourced). However, formats force you to re-create the whole fonnat, which can be an enormous amount of work to add a single item (4) No ability to mix character and numeric Formats are either strictly numeric or character. There are times when the ability to use either without loading multiple formats is useful.

"k &. Co"" Hoffman Estates, IL. Viswanathan Ramakrishnan, University of Illinois, Chicago, IL. John M, Davis, Illinois State Psychiatric Institute, Chicago, IL. ABSTRACT Clinical trials comparing treatments that follow patients over a period often suffer from patient dropouts either due to clinical improvement or deterioration. These dropouts are usually due to a particular response to a treatment or due to lack of efficacy rather than occurring at random, Most missing data methods operate under the assumptions that the dropouts are ""missing at random,"" which usually does not hold, There are only a few methods try to tackle the problem of data missing due to truncation, It has been shown that these methods can not provide satisfactory results in the truncated distribution. Under the assumption of a symmetric distribution for the random error in a model at any given time point, a SAS macro program to produce symmetric maximum likelihood estimation for truncated data has been developed. Based on the symmetry assumption, collected sample data at any given time is partitioned into three segments: (1) data beyond a threshold that are missing due to dropout; (2) the lower tail of the distribution, which corresponds to the mirror image of the unobserved portion; and (3) the data in between. Since the lower and middle part of the data are observed, the mean and the variance-covariance matrix for the truncated distribution are estimated under the symmetry property.

SAM provides you with what you need for professional system development, for example program control and a development, test and production hierarchy. Niklas Data Group Niklas Data Group is a group of SAS consulting companies owned by the founders and management. Since the beginning in 1987, our vision is to be the premier provider of solutions based on SAS. In 1994 we were the first in Scandinavia to be certified as a SAS Quality Partner. Currently, we have offices in Sweden, Norway, Finland and the Netherlands. Our head office is situated in Netherlands and during the next five years we have plans to open offices in Denmark, Belguim and Germany. We are unique in many aspects but the main one is that we only work with SAS. Niklas Data Group employs more than SO consultants specialized in building SAS applications for organizations and corporations. Our plans are to grow to more than 100 consultants during the year, due to the large demand of expertise in the areas we specialize in. Some examples of solutions we have helped our clients with are Data Warehouse, Executive Information Systems, Quality Statistics applications, Analysis applications, Forecasting applications and numerous different statistical applications. Why do we need a development environment? First of all, we need program control.

Market players are changing. Customer expectations are increasing. The business of telecorrununications itself is evolving. In fact, the only constant in the telecommunications industry since divestiture in 19&4 has been change. Indeed, if anything, this dynamic industry has become more unpredictable than ever, adding challenge and complexity to the tasks of industry workers, managers, and decision makers. To gain and retain competitive advantage, it is critical that the decision makers within the telecommunications industry have access to the right information at the· right time regarding their customers, their products and services, and their competitors. Information technology will be the key enabler to this competitive advantage. This paper explores industry trends in the service sector and how they are changing the marketplace.

", MO Abstract This workshop will walk users through two graphs that have won in the SUG! grapbks competition. One graph uses PROC GPLOT with several 'tricks' to place all the infonnation on the graph. In addition to the use of an annotate dataset, this graph uses options such as offset and blank title statements. The graph won the competition at SUG! 20. The other graph focuses on the use of PROC GMAP and won first place in Best Presentation of Data-Color at SUGI 18. It shows data for potential sales by county for an individual state plus the 'nearby' section of the surrounding states. The map is used to truly show data for areas such as the Cincinnati metropolitan area which is in three states (OhiO, Kentucky and Incliana). Individual state maps would be misleading for this type of data. The graph also uses annotate to label selected cities on the map.

"ranklin, Mainridge Management Ltd, London, UK A BSTRACT The need for cross-platform applications is increasing as individuals and companies are becoming aware that the future of their own in-house or packaged applications need to be able to work on two or more operating systems, or migrate from one operating system to another quickly and with ease. Investment in time and resources to develop a new application on an existing operating system is often lost when a new operating system is brought in. Rather than loose that investment many adopt the attitude of keep the old operating system going while new software is to be developed on the new operating system. Others though spend significant amounts of time and resources often rewriting from scratch new applications doing the same job that the old application did but in the new operating system. SAS®, though its software and Multi-Vendor Support environment, addresses these problems and brings together the opportunity of creating a single SAS/AF® application on one operating system and distributing that single master to any one of the numerous other operating systems that the SAS® System supports, and have it running in a matter of minutes, and not days, or even months as occasionally occurs in other development environments.

"In a typical clinical trial, especially large and/ or multicenter ones, there are many sources of data, including electronic data transfers from sites, central labs and CROs. While the data may come in many formats, the question arises: how to load these data in to appropriate databases. In this context, we have taken a holistic approach whereby SAS is used as the platform of choice to deal with these data transfers. SAS transport datasets coming in are converted to host SAS datasets, and required data transformations and manipulations are applied. Once the data is in the desired format, an output file is written and then, using SAS/ACCESS® for Informix, an Informix table is created and populated with the data from the SAS datasets. In this process, UNIX utilities are also used as an umbrella, to perform various tasks such as input verification, error checking, invoking SAS programs, cleaning the data, and to archive the associated files. This approach allows us to develop one-step utilities that are easy to run, easy to document and reduces the need to remember a plethora of steps and the need to follow these steps in a given order.

"                            1 Incorporating External Data Into the Data Warehouse Tim Walters, InfoTech Marketing, Littleton, CO   Most data warehouses focus solely on extracting data from internal operating systems. While this is valuable, additional data is available externally that can significantly enhance the value of the data warehouse. This paper presents ways that an intermediate user of Base SAS ® (with a little SAS/ACCESS ® thrown in) can incorporate external data into a data warehouse and report on such data. External data is defined as all data outside the organizations operating systems. Data from the companys spreadsheets can be directly included through SAS/ACCESS. Data from outside the company can be included at a summarized or detailed level by creating match variables and using the MERGE statement.   Most data warehouse development efforts focus on freeing the companys data from its operating systems and allowing users to query against the data. While this is a necessary first step in designing a data warehouse, and most users are happy that they can finally access the companys internal data, a data warehouse with only internal data is like undeveloped land: it has intrinsic value, but its value increases as it is built upon. External data is like that building: it adds much additional value to the warehouse. This is particularly true for marketing, which may need external data to analyze the companys customers, evaluate market share, compare actual results to plan, etc. While this paper has a marketing slant, the techniques can be applied to any external data.   External data is defined as any data not contained in the companys operating systems. In can be data that the company has, but is not in an operating system. For example, budgeting data may be kept in spreadsheets in a P.C. and not be included in the companys accounting system. In this case, the company already has the data but needs it in the data warehouse for analysis purposes.",PAPER116.pdf
"One of the dirty secrets of most data warehouse projects is that they require vast amounts of disk drive space and robust computers for successful implementation. Unfortunately, not every organization that lusts for a comprehensive data warehouse can finance the tab for the hardware that may be required to create the warehouse of their vision. Bassett Consulting Services has helped two clients make better use of limited computing resources through a two step approach. First, an active data dictionary permits point and click selection, renaming, joining, and sub-setting of data, even when some of the elements reside on tape cartridges or in hierarchical files. Then code engines create SAS code on the fly to extract the requested data from their actual physical locations and transform the data into SAS data sets. These data sets even contain variable labels and formats, courtesy of the data dictionary, and are ready for further analytical processing.",PAPER117.pdf

Object-oriented design and pattern languages are also discussed. INTRODUCTION One of the hottest topics in the industry today is data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP). Although, data warehousing has been around in some form or another since the inception of data storage, people were never able to exploit the information that was wastefully sitting on a tape somewhere in a back room. Today, however, technology has advanced to a point to make access to this information an interactive reality. Organizations across the country and around the world are seeking expertise in this exploding field of data organization and manipulation. It is not a surprise, really, that business users want to get a better look at their data. Today, business opportunities measure in days, instead of months or years, and the more information empowering an entrepreneur or other business person, the better the chances of beating a competitor to the punch with a new product or service. The interesting thing about this new genre of computer ingenuity, is its dynamic nature. Business drives data warehousing, and the only constant in business is evolution-or elimination. Therefore, warehouses and OLAP tools also need",PAPER118.pdf
"a Research and Education Foundation, San Francisco, CA 1.0 Abstract Massive clinical research data are stored in HP-UNIX Oracle 7.1.6 with SQL/NET V2 tables and managed by Oracle programmers who are unfamiliar with the SAS system. The data need to be converted to SAS data sets for analysis and presentation. Depending on the situation, there are different methods of conversion. Different alternatives were investigated and three methods were compared. This paper demonstrates the following three conversion methods investigated by a SAS programmer with some knowledge of the SQL language and UNIX shell script : - Using Base SAS , Oracle SQL/Plus, and HP-UNIX shell script. - Using the available SAS/ACCESS module in menu-driven mode. - Using the available SAS/ACCESS module in a batch mode. For each of the above three methods of data conversion, the advantages and disadvantages of each method will be pointed out. The SAS code and the UNIX Shell script will also be presented as well as relevant features of SAS/ACCESS and SQL. A real case study will be used throughout as an example.

"Many data warehouse implementations are hampered by the inability of inexperienced users to construct accurate queries. Users must either rely upon canned reports, or upon the whims and availability of programmers. The development of a graphical user interface (GUI) as a user tool can help alleviate these problems by giving the user power to develop his or her own queries without extensive knowledge of the structure of the data. This paper describes the development and implementation of a GUI front-end user interface called TABLES with SAS/AFand SAS Screen Control Language (SCL). This interface is Windows compatible. TABLES allows the user to access a PC-based data warehouse of employee related data maintained in SAS libraries. By choosing from the available options, the user can select and customize reports, including titles and footnotes. TABLES provides power and flexibility for the inexperienced user, while freeing programmers to spend more time programming.",PAPER120.pdf
"Computer Systems professionals have always been faced with the problem of dirty data. In the past, errors were detected using batch edit programs to identify errors. The output from these batch edits was then reviewed, corrections were transcribed onto coding sheets, then keyed, and finally applied to the data using a batch update program. With the advent of custom interactive data entry systems, many edit checks were built into the data entry system, replacing the batch edit process. There are clear advantages to this, but in the interest of speed and simplicity, the data entry edits were not as robust or thorough as the batch edits of the past. Many complex checks were left undone. The approach that we describe uses the SAS® system, and SAS/AF® to combine a customized interactive data entry system with improved batch systems, taking advantage of the strengths of each to produce an integrated system for data entry and cleaning that is both thorough and easy to use. Methodologies such as those outlined here are important additions to the front end of any data warehousing effort.

"form permits rapid applications development. SAS supplies several classes of objects that the developer can use to quickly prototype and implement systems. However, in developing applications for use in the pharmaceutical industry, it is useful to augment these classes with additional classes that provide robust data management and reporting capabilities. Classes that provide generic tools to subset data, browse data, move data, and report data are useful in the clinical research environment. STATPROBE, Inc., has developed an integrated data management system, using SAS/AF as the platform. The system incorporates security and tools that assist the valid production and analysis of the clinical data. Various modules in the system support numerous clinical data management activities.

"A few years ago, Community Care Network, a provider of services to the health care industry, faced a major crisis. One of the services they provided for trading partners was becoming difficult to deliver on time. Initially, the service was provided on an adhoc basis, which sufficed while the subscribers were few. As business increased, CCN staff were finding it difficult to meet schedule expectations and were in jeopardy of losing their business. The Information Services group recommended developing a system that would provide CCN with a uniform approach to providing the trading partners with a quality product in a reasonable time period. Because of the complexity of the process it was almost mandatory that a traditional structured approach be used in all phases of the project. The SAS System was chosen over C and other alternatives as the development environment.

It  focuses on the need to be flexible at all stages, and the reality that building a data warehouse is an iterative process. Introduction Nightmare or golden opportunity? The division head tells you to build a data warehouse. He also tells you to do it using a release of software that has not yet passed through Quality Assurance. In addition, you will use a product that is still in the development stage, and finally, your resources are scattered across several departments. While these constraints are unique to this project, you can be sure that your data warehousing project will probably be equally unique. So where do you start? In my case, the company library. I had heard about data warehousing, read about it in the trade publications and even listened to some marketing people discuss the market potential; but what did those words mean? As  you might expect, the library had many books and articles on the subject, and after reading a half dozen books and too many articles to count, I was able to see that the experts agreed at the macro level, meaning 'data warehousing is a good thing,' but disagreed at the micro,' this is how you should implement your data warehouse.

Overview of Data Mining To convert the value of the data warehouse or data mart into strategic business information, many companies are turning to data mining, an emerging technology based on a new generation of software. Data mining combines techniques including statistical analysis, visualization, induction, and neural networks to explore large amounts of data and discover relationships and patterns that shed light on business problems. In turn, companies can use these findings for more profitable, proactive decision making and competitive advantage. Data mining was designed for exploiting massive amounts of data. This process can be more efficient if you first define what the business problem is, and then determine the amount of data you will need to solve the problem. By taking this ""bottom up"" approach to data mining and involving upper management in the understanding of business problems and the potential ROI, the process will be much more acceptable and the goals attainable. SAS Institute defines data mining as the process of selecting, exploring, and modeling large amounts of data to uncover previously unknown patterns for a business advantage.

Abstract This paper will discuss the implementation of a dimensional data warehouse. A dimensional warehouse is a design or modeling technique that was developed by Ralph Kimball (Kimball, 1996) to help us develop our data models in a structured, visual way. Here we will discuss a strategy for the design, development and implementation of this structure using tools available with the SAS@ System. In addition, we will talk about several modeling techniques, implementation of logical and physical schemas, transformation and aggregation strategies, and the loading and unloading of data to the warehouse. Scope of this Paper Data warehousing can mean a Iot of things to a lot of people. This paper will provide a broad level perspective on the implementation of a simple data warehouse, or perhaps more accurately, a data mart. Occasionally, we will dip down to a technical level on specific issues and then resume our broad perspective.

We describe a method that we use for running SAS in a UNIX environment that allows us to take advantage of both of these methods simultaneously. By the careful application of a few coding standards and with the help of some custom key definitions in display manager, we are able to utilize the features of the interactive environment for editing our source code and reviewing the results, while we virtually replace the standard SAS submit command with our own batch submit procedure.    We find that using this technique has easily more than doubled our SAS productivity.               Overview of the Technique                                                                                The technique involves using the SAS Display Manager System to edit your programs, and then submitting them to run as independent UNIX background processes instead of using the display manager ""submit"" command.

This is especially true in the United States, where telecommunications, Internet, video and audio services all fall under the larger umbrella of the information superhighway. Our project team is adept at providing customized business solutions to telecommunications managers by creating specialized information systems to meet their individual needs. We design personalized systems which transcend the traditional boundaries of data warehousing systems by gathering and storing important data, analyzing and transforming the data, and then summarizing and reordering it in accordance with the demands of the user. This provides a dynamic and efficient frontend presentation and reporting tools that transform the users from reactive recipients of hard copy reports to competitive executives poised to make efficient, well informed decisions.

With proper analysis of existing meta data, it is possible to efficiently generate meta data for the data warehouse. This paper will examine the importance of meta data for a data warehouse and will present Meta Data Designer, a tool facilitating the design of an effective meta data for a data warehouse. It will draw distinctions among different kinds of meta data and demonstrate the importance of meta data in an effective data warehouse. The Meta Data Designer in this example is shown with clinical data, but the concepts could be applied to a range of data warehouses.   Meta data is information (or data) about data. Since this definition is so broad, meta data can be interpreted in many ways and may be confusing. One simple example of a meta data for a SAS ® data set is the results from a PROC CONTENTS. This provides attributes about the data sets and its variables. Other examples of meta data collected for a data warehouse may pertain to:  the data structure  data warehouse table attributes and structures  mapping from the operational database to the data warehouse  currency or timeliness (Delvin 1997, p.55) of the data: i.e. history of updated time, schedule application run time  utilization (Delvin 1997, p.55): i.e. tracking use of a particular function, tracking security  the source data feeding the data warehouse  the transformation of data as it passes into the data warehouse  Meaning (Delvin 1997, p.56) or an interpretation of the data for a business objective The previous examples show how meta data can be used to fit the specific needs of a particular warehouse.

"1 Introduction to FRAME Entries in SAS/AF® Software John C. Boling, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC. Introduction SAS/AF software, announced in 1985, is an application facility for building interactive enterprise information systems. As the user interacts with the application, the application can customize and execute SAS source code interactively, noninteractively, or even on a remote machine. Prior to the introduction of the FRAME entry, entries within a SAS/AF application could not easily intermix text and graphics. The FRAME entry, introduced in Release 6.08, supports the intermixing of text and graphics and the use of industry accepted graphical user interface widgets, objects, and controls. Graphical User Interfaces Graphical User Interfaces are multi-window, graphicoriented user applications. Typically, they contain window elements such as bit-mapped and structured graphics, icons, pull-down and pop-up menus, command buttons, scroll bars, and sliders. Most also use a mouse device and pointer control. With GUIbased applications, users typically navigate through the application by pointing and clicking on their selections using a mouse. Figure 1 GUI applications are often simpler and quicker to use than command based interfaces. For example, GUI menu choices can be icons that users select instead of typing numbers or letters on a command line or pressing function keys. GUI applications are also more intuitive. Rather than requiring users to remember a series of commands and options, the interface prompts for the next action or choice. GUI applications enable users to maneuver quickly and easily through a series of tasks using graphical images. Object Oriented Programming Terms The FRAME entry is predicated on object oriented programming structures. It is helpful to understand these basic terms. The design of an object oriented system begins not with the task to be performed but rather the aspects of the real world that need to be modeled in order to perform that t",PAPER145.pdf
"PROC REPORT: AN INTRODUCTION Ray Pass ASG, Inc. TO THE BATCH LANGUAGE In 1990, the SAS Institute included the experimental release of the REPORT procedure with version 6.06 of the SAS System. This was followed in 1991 with various alphdbeta releases of REPORT, and a 1992 production release in version 6.07. PROC REPORT is a powerfid replacement (addition) for PROC PRINT, and it has the full support of SAS Institute, which was lacking with the ill-fated PROC QPRINT. The QPRINT procedure could also have inherited PROC PRINTs role as the main report writing tool of the SAS* System, but major development efforts were thrown instead behind the REPORT procedure, with its raft of new features. The result is PROC REPORT, a powerful new report writer which is certainly destined to become a SAS System productivity workhorse. The main thrust behind PROC REPORT has been its interactive WYSIWYG ability, in which reports are designed online via screen-painting manipulation of actual output. When the desired result is achieved, the design and structure of the report can be saved as a catalog entry and called up repeatedly for additional runs with new sets of data. The design can then be modilled at any time, and can either be replaced or saved as an additional entry. This is all done in a Display Manager-like environment, and will certainly attract users comfortable with working interactively. Although the batch language of PROC REPORT is also available with version 6.07 or later (not so with earlier experimental releases, or at least not easily available), it has not received the acclaim or publicity that is afforded the interactive product. In actual fact however, the batch language is every bit as powerful and feature-laden as its online cousin, and is an ahnost mirror-image. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the batch version of PROC REPORT through a progressive series of annotated examples.

"VA Charles E. Shipp, Consultant, Los Angeles CA Abstract JMP under Windows is highly graphical, inviting us to interact with our data. Along with graphical tools for data visualization, JMP provides us with sophisticated statistical analyses. This combination of visualization and statistical analysis helps us to make good decisions grounded by a sound knowledge of our data. Because JMP is highly interactive, the best way to learn JMP is to use JMP, so in this hands-on workshop, we will learn how to get around in JMP by  working with the JMP data table  investigating variables using the Distribution of Y platform and the Correlation of Ys platform  analyzing relationships such as ANOVA and simple linear regression with Fit Y by X  learning about additional JMP features. Welcome to JMP Since the best way to learn JMP is to use JMP, well start by showing you an example based on actual analyses that are typical in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Then, well give you a chance to use JMP and work with that same data. Working with the JMP data table The data consist of a variety of measurements obtained on a wafer which will eventually be broken down into semiconductor chips. Four sample measurements have been taken during all three shifts over three days. The temperature may vary within these samples. A resistivity test is made, an intervention occurs, and then at seven different sites on each wafer a measurement is made. Figure 1 shows the data as it appears in the",PAPER147.pdf

"1 An Introduction to SAS/ASSIST Software ® Linda P. Atkinson, Economic Research Service/USDA, Washington, D.C. INTRODUCTION SAS/ASSIST software is a user-friendly front-end to the SAS System. Its push-button menus provide options for many of the tasks you would want to perform. Selections are made and acted upon without the user having to write any SAS code. Programs can be saved that will be run repetitively. The SAS/ASSIST interface can be customized to better suit the needs of the user and the environment of the work to be accomplished. ASSIST is designed to be self-explanatory; however, some hands-on experience can be a helpful training aid for the novice user. SAS/ASSIST can be invoked by typing assist on the command line, by clicking on the appropriate icon on the toolbar, or by selecting Globals and SAS/ASSIST from the pull-down or pop-up menus. The default Primary Menu will appear. DATA MANAGEMENT One of the first things you might want to do in the SAS System is browse or edit a set of data. Click on the DATA MGMT button in ASSIST. A wide range of tasks can be specified from the following menu, including doing SQL queries on the data, importing data from other formats, creating subsets, and so on. Some of the options require specific SAS products to be licensed in order to be enabled, such as SAS/FSP to do full-screen browsing or editing of ® SAS data sets and SAS/ACCESS to access external ® database files. An INDEX button can help you get to a specific task easily if you are unsure as to which path would get you to it, and a HELP button is provided as standard on most ASSIST screens. Click on EDIT/BROWSE, Edit data and Tabular format to view the data as a table where the rows are observations and the columns are variables.

With this flexibility comes a complexity that often discourages a new user from taking the plunge and learning SAS/GRAPH. Learning and using SAS/GRAPH does not need to be difficult. Nor are the more complex aspects of SAS/GRAPH always needed to produce graphic output that is just what your boss wants. This workshop will introduce three of the primary procedures used by SAS/GRAPH, and introduce the options and statements that make them special. We will start with TITLEs and FOOTNOTEs. PROC GPLOT will be used to create a scatterplot which will be enhanced with SYMBOL statements and a number of options. Several variations of GCHART will be demonstrated and the creation of title slides using GSLIDE will be discussed briefly. Options specific to SAS/GRAPH and how and when they should be used will be handled with an introduction to the GOPTIONS statement.

"The Art and Science of Biostatistical Display Dominic T. Moore, Duke Clinical Research Institute, Durham, North Carolina Introduction Graphs communicate. There is both an art and a science to the visual display of biostatistical data. This paper is about visual communication between the data analyst and an audience of interest. The analyst wants to tell the story of the data. The major emphasis is placed on the principles as described by Edward TUFTE in his articles, books and seminars, This paper will provide practical guidelines for the data analyst who is looking to communicate data analysis results by means of presentation graphics. This is not about exploratory data analysis, the interaction of the data analyst and the computer, but the art and science of visual communication. The author asserts with only a hint of exaggeration, that he puts forth not one original idea, but rather restates the major principles by the whos who of graphs and data visualization, (Cleveland, Playfair, ,Tufte, Tukey, Wainer, Young). The goal is to give guidelines so that one can strive for excellence in graphics whose principles come from graphic design in art and science. The Purpose of Graphs A good graph will: l Save the user time. Trivia and extraneous matter is dispensed with - information is sifted and refined. l Gain user attention. The display should be pleasing and exciting to the eye and generate reader motivation. l Show relationships and permit study of the data. The user should be able to look for regularities/ irregularities within the data. Study of data points and their spatial relationships to each other may reveal meanings not otherwise observed. In deciding whether to use a chart or a graph, the form which best shows the relationships should be used. l Suggest new ideas. A good graphic might reveal connections that otherwise would not be perceived. l Make efficient use of information: It will display fundamental relationships by way of visual conventions.

"PROC GMAP: How I Learned to Tolerate (And Almost Love) Annotati n g Keith J. Brown University of North Carolina - General Administration Chapel Hill, NC INTRODUCTION Once upon a time, PROC GMAP was my most feared graphics procedure. Long after I had come to use and appreciate the GPLOT and GCHART procedures, I still shrank from attempting to use GMAP because of one word: annotation.  Even after I became comfortable producing basic distribution maps, anything beyond that seemed an insurmountable task because of the need to calculate the position of innumerable points. About a year ago, I was called upon to produce a map of North Carolina population distribution by county using another package, and discovered that there was no way to pass data into it. The patterns had to be applied to each of one hundred counties by clicking inside the county's border and selecting the appropriate pattern. That experience convinced me that it was time to take another look at annotating maps with SAS® .  Like many of the things we fear when we are young and foolish, it turned out to be a much less daunting task than I had always thought it would be. FINDING THE DATA My first concern was how to get the data with which to annotate the maps. The SAS System includes several data sets that can be used for annotation, such as 'MAPS.USCENTER' (visual midpoints of each state), 'MAPS.USCITY' (major cities in each state), and 'MAPS.CNTYNAME' (county names). While these data sets are helpful, they don't cover each state in depth. The rise of the Internet has made accessing geographical data much simpler. The ""How Far Is It"" site, www.indo.com, was the first place that I found help in finding the location of many of the cities and towns not covered by SAS' data sets. Later, I discovered that the United States Census Bureau has an electronic gazetteer of counties, incorporated places, and zipcodes available at the URL http://tiger.census.gov/places.html or for anonymous FTP from www.census.gov/pub",PAPER168.pdf

Issues that affect how intuitive and user friendly an application is will be discussed, along with some examples of subclassing that promote the usability of an application. Introduction The classes that are provided with SAS/AF can achieve a wide range of tasks. Using these classes as they are is often satisfactory, however often an application has particular requirements. These may be achieved with the supplied classes, but may require additional code. The nature of OOP allows the creation of subclasses which incorporates this additional functionality. These subclasses can be added to the toolbox of classes that are used to build Frame applications. Scope In this presentation, it is my intention is to demonstrate some real life applications where subclasses that I have developed have been used to achieve tasks specific to the clients application. Some of the subclasses will be examined at code level and there will be some discussion on some aspects of application design.

JMP's charter is to harness both statistics and graphics together at one time so that data analysis becomes understandable, enjoyable, and even fun! The use of leverage plots, desirability and interaction profilers, parallel axis graphs, Gabriel biplots, the interactive linking of graphs, and the use of animation, magnifying. lasso, and slider tools will be shown with examples from science, engineering and finance. Introduction: JMP is to data analysis what X-rays and Ultrasound images are to medicine. Sall (1990) in describing leverage plots gives this analogy, ""consider the case of a doctor who can learn a lot by examining the patient from the outside, but a series of X-ray pictures that show how things look inside is often essential for the best diagnosis. What the linear-model doctor needs is an inside picture of the data - one that shows how each observation functions in producing parameter estimates and test statistics"". This analogy in fact extends to other design features in JMP. It is the interactive and revealing nature of JMP that many times makes it an excellent tool for data diagnosis.

"GRAPHICAL SOLUTIONS FOR MARKET INTELLIGENCE Frederick Pratter, Abt Associates Inc., Cambridge, MA Perceptua/ mapping has been in common use as an analytic tool in market research for a number of years, yet there are probably almost as many definitions of the term as researchers who use it. A generally acceptable definition would certainly include the following features. First, a group of respondents (customers) are asked to compare a set of products or brands on a collection of attributes. The ratings can include customers perceptions as well as preferences, as long as the data are ordinal. These ratings or rankings are then combined into linear combinations (principal components) that each account for some unique portion of the variation in the original data. Finally, these linear functions are plotted in order to display the information graphically. The SA@ System can be used to produce several kinds of perceptual maps, in particular multidimensional preference (MDPREF) plots. The SAS Institute offers a two-day public course called Mar/reting Research: Practical Applications Using the SAP System which covers several graphical techniques, including M DP REF. The original idea for thkspaper came out of some of the discussions in this course, as well as from several papers by Warren Kuhfeld and others at the SAS Institute. It should also be noted that the graphical methods presented here are not cutting edge technologies. They can all be run using only the SASISTAP and SAS/G RAPl% products; SAS/lML@or SASIA? is not required, The focus is instead on why one would want to use them-- how this kind of perceptual mapping can help to discover research solutions to market questions. The 1980s car preference data set (included as PRQEX1 in the SAS/STA~ sample library) is surely one of the most analyzed response sets in market research. Even for those who do not remember the Ford Pinto or the Plymouth Volare, the original MDPREF analysis is nonetheless a useful starting",PAPER179.pdf

"hnology with SAS software. SAS Institute provides a beta SAS/SHARE*NET driver for JDBC. In addition, we provide classes that allow Java applications and applets to create a remote SAS session, submit SAS statements, and retrieve results generated by the submitted statements. This paper describes how to use these class libraries and address client/server configuration and performance issues. Introduction Since its introduction in mid-1995, Java and applets have become an integral part of the World Wide Web. Java is a rich programming language that enables Web programmers to create sophisticated and responsive client/server applications. Because Java is portable and secure, users of Web applications can be confident that those applications will execute properly and not corrupt their computers. SAS Institute provides a SAS/SHARE*NET driver for JDBC, a driver for Remote Computing Services, and several drivers to access both SAS data and SAS computing facilities. By using these drivers, SAS programmers can make SAS resources available to a much wider user community via the Web. Overview of Java Java is an object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, Inc. Java source code is compiled to a byte stream, which is merely a long sequence of bytes. The byte stream is interpreted by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Since Java is interpreted, the code will run on any platform that has an implementation of the JVM. This enables Web authors to embed executable content,",PAPER183.pdf
"1 Choosing a Method for Connecting Java to the SAS ® System Across the Internet CGI, JDBC or Socket? Larry Hoyle Institute for Public Policy and Business Research University of Kansas The SAS ® system can communicate with Java  applets across the internet (or within an intranet) in a number of ways. An applet can emulate an HTML form and connect to a SAS program via a CGI script. An applet can use the Java Database Connectivity (JDBC  ) API to connect to a SAS/SHARE*NET ® server. Applets can also open sockets to SAS programs using the SAS System's socket file access method. This paper explores the strengths and limitations of these methods and shows their use in IPPBR's ""Statistics Kansas"" WWW pages. Java & the SAS System Java is a programming language, based on C++, with features which make it well suited for use with the Internet. Java programs designed to run under a World Wide Web browser are called applets. Java applet clients can communicate with a SAS System server in at least three ways. Common Gateway Interface (CGI) First, an HTML form can invoke a remote SAS program through a Common Gateway Interface (CGI) script. The SAS program can set up for, and return a pointer to a Java Applet. The browser will then start the applet which may, in turn, read additional data from the server. The CGI component of the SAS IntrNet product 1 will also allow this approach to starting an applet. An example, with source code, of launching a Java applet from SAS CGI script program can be found at: http://www.ukans.edu/cwis/units/IPPBR/ksdata/ ksah/javamap.htm                                                        1 This product did not have its final name when this article went to press. The CGI method has some disadvantages.  Once the applet starts it cannot communicate with the SAS program which launched it.  Unless you are using the CGI component of the SAS IntrNet product, each time a connection is opened the SAS system must be loaded on the server, causing some delay",PAPER184.pdf
"Lets Not Forget E-Mail Jack Shoemaker, United Risk Assessment & Management, Cheshire, CT With all the excitement surrounding the growth and popularity of the World Wide Web, its easy to forget about that ubiquitous piece of the Internet known as electronic mail, or e-mail for short. Nearly everyone who browses SGML documents - the raw material of the World Wide Web - has an e-mail address to boot. The same can not be said for the converse. Plenty of people have e-mail, but arent able to browse SGML documents. SGML? Although SGML is the correct way to refer this class of formatted text documents, HTML is more commonly used, and [ will simply use the term Web document in this paper to mean anything that you can retrieve with a Web browser. So, if youre a content provider - someone who creates Web documents in the hope that someone else will drop by for a visit - youve lopped off a good potilon of your potential market, if you limit yourself to only Web- based information delivery. And, if youre a potential information consumer with only e-mail access, you have a legitimate gripe with the content provider. But this is rapidly changing. Although certainly true a year and a half ago, and mostly true even a year ago, Internet access providers have made Web browsing so accessible, that the notion of e-mail without browsing capability is already something of an anachronism. Will the opposite occur? Will there be legions of Web browsers who dont have e-mail? Probably not because e-mail provides an information delivery channel which complements and enhances the Web-based environment. Consider the friend of many a SAS programmer - SAS-L. SAS-L is a mailing list managed and run by a piece of software known as LISTSERV.

Many organizations have already found that internal Intranets can help empower their employees through more timely and less costly information flow. At Statistics Canada the Informatics Branch is utilizing the Intranet technology to communicate with its clients and provide them with up to date information on its services and rates. This paper describes our fully automated process for summarizing data on the mainframe and storing the graphical result in a Web page on our Intranet. Introduction This paper documents an example of a fully automated process to display numeric data from a SAS library on our mainframe as a graphic in a Web page on our Intranet. We start with mainframe data, move it to a PC to generate the graph, then store the graphic on a Web server where it is accessed by our clients. We have found SAS 6.11 to be a convenient tool for producing the GIF format files commonly used in Web applications. The feature is not available in the mainframe version, so the data must be transferred to a PC or server for GIF creation. It is unlikely that you will cost justify a properly licensed copy of SAS on your Web server just for GIF production, so you too will probably follow our example of using a PC as an interim measure.

It deals with an automated SAS/AF ® Frame system designed to create and print a number of graphs and produce suitable graph image files for inclusion on WEB pages. Topics discussed include drill-down design, programming techniques for creating GIF files, and the creation of custom SAS Device Drivers. INTRODUCTION SAS software is a major leader in information and management systems. It has powerful features that support the creation of customized hard copy output that includes both data and graphic output. Until now, SAS custom graphs could not take their place in the Web world because of:  Sophistication of SAS custom graphs  True portability across platforms  Interactive way to create and process graphs This paper focuses on an In-depth analysis of these problem areas. ANALYSIS Design Issue Hard copy of SAS/GRAPH images depends on the resolution available on the printable media and display device respectively. In order to display graphs as images on a WEB page, you need to consider the following:  Height and width of the viewable screen or WEB browser. Usually, 1 inch of viewable area is almost equal to 95 pixels. Proper use of pixels in the image will improve the quality of the image.  Should the displayed image be permitted to extend beyond the viewable screen? If the answer is yes,' then the quality of the image could be improved by using SAS/GRAPH software. This way the hard copy versi",PAPER192.pdf

"Proper applications are logically divided into layers. This division allows the developer to derive generic templates that are reusable in different types of software systems. Templates promote the logical organization of applications into generic and application-specific elements. Templates also enhance usability because they give applications a consistent presentation. For the developer, the advantages of using templates are rapid application development and consistency across multiple applications. The consistency provided by templates contributes to a reduced learning curve for end users as they become familiar with many applications developed with use of the same templates. Standard templates handle system level details like registering users, maintaining a data dictionary, tracking system activity with an error log, typical database management functions, and typical dialogs with the user. Templates also provide default behavior in an application. An application can completely override default behavior for any special application needs or perform tailored behavior and branch to the default behavior. Templates are organized in SAS® catalogs. An application is developed quickly in SAS by assembling template entries that are stored in template catalog files. This paper describes different types of templates and methods for integrating generic templates and customized elements into a complete software package.",PAPER2.pdf
"1         Formal program validation is something new to a lot of SAS programmers. Sure, weve always thoroughly tested our programs, but we normally wouldnt have created a well-detailed test plan before we started developing programs, nor would we have thoroughly documented all of the testing and checking that we did do. But thanks to changes in how the FDA and other drug regulatory agencies view computer systems (eg, programs), we need to start developing and testing our programs in a more highly structured, and highly documented, manner. This need for a formal validation process led Parke-Davis to create the Validation Master Plan (VMP). The VMP fully embraces the System Life Cycle method of system development. System Life Cycle (SLC) methodology breaks program development down into many steps, with some documentation for each step. In general terms, those steps are: 1. collecting user requirements, 2. creating programming specifications, 3. creating a validation protocol, 4. system development and testing, 5. executing the validation protocol, 6. user acceptance, 7. system integration testing, 8. change control management, and finally 9. system retirement. But the SLC method does more than just give you a lot of paper to file. It gives you a well-defined development methodology that offers a number of benefits. This paper will discuss those benefits by comparing program development using the SLC method against how programs were typically developed at Parke-Davis. Not all of the SLC steps will be looked at, but we will look at those steps that seem to have the biggest benefits.     What could be considered requirements were gathered in many different ways.

The primary benefits include providing access to all of the resources on your network as well as maximizing the use of these resources. However, as client/server processing has been adopted and implemented by the business community, additional requirements have emerged. In today's complex business world, tasks are best accomplished by a series of programs that work together as an application to produce a result. These programs can be spread across multiple computing environments that may or may not be homogeneous. Often the programs that make up an application need to run on their own schedules, independent of the other programs. Also, as applications become more distributed, businesses will strive to simplify their networks and to minimize the number of direct connections that must be maintained and restarted in the event of a network failure. However, one requirement remains the same whether all of the programs that comprise an application run on a single processor or each program runs on a separate heterogeneous processor: programs must communicate with each other in order to accomplish the goal of the application. The message and queuing facilities that are available in the SAS System can address all of these needs by using a flexible method of data exchange through messages. This paper will describe the direct-messaging and messagequeuing concepts and introduce the messaging services that have been added to the SAS System to allow you to easily write applications that can communicate with each other on a single processor or across a network.

Excessive collection of data is not only very labor intensive but also unnecessary. Data collected during previous semesters can be used as population information. Since true values are known, systematic samples can be generated and results compared to the population parameters. Introduction Systematic sampling is conducted by sampling every k th item in a population after the first item is selected at random from the first k items. If the setting is a manufacturing process, it is easy to instruct someone to pull every 5 th   item off the line for testing. In marketing, every 10 th person could be polled about what product they prefer. It is important to remember that the first item must be randomly selected for the statistical theory to hold true. If there is random ordering in the population of the variable values, then systematic sampling is considered to be equivalent to a random sample.

Often, process experimenters will repeat an experiment on different lots (batches of wafers grouped together) and thus the effects of lot-to-lot variability is needed in the experiment analysis methodology. We show in this paper how to start with a very simple simplistic view of the data in a designed experiment and progressively add complexities which mimic reality much closer. We show that if one ignores these complexities, the results of an analysis can be rather misleading or even completely reversed.

"er is to paint a statistical portrait of the current economic state of regional theatre in the United States. How have regional theatre companies fared during the 1980's and into the 90's? As a result of rising production costs, increased competition for audience, and widely acknowledged diminishing federal support, are these theatres now subject to the same financial strains as Broadway theatre? This study uses the SAS System to reveal trends in the bottom line in the state of representative regional theatre. In particular, PROC PLOT, PROC CORR, PROC MEANS and PROC REG are used to identify and test for the significance of trends in regional theatre in the 1980's and 1990's. The author concludes with comments on the ease of learning and using the SAS System. HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVE ON REGIONAL THEATRE Following the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, territorial limits of the United States had begun to greatly expand. Florida, Texas, the southwest and California were added by the 1840's. As settlers began to move into these new territories, theatre, too, expanded beyond the regions of the east coast. By the 1850's approximately thirty-five regional, resident acting companies were in existence. However, by the late 19th century these companies were undermined by touring shows featuring well-known international 'stars' as well as increasing production costs (resulting from the demand for scenic splendor, realistic detail and spectacular special effects). The result was the long-run poli",PAPER218.pdf
"Medical diagnostics firms manufacture kits to screen individuals for a variety of medical conditions. These kits are designed to detect such conditions based on a test sample from an individual being screened. A particular condition is detected as an abnormal optical density above or below a cutoff value. Before such a kit can be sold, however, the kit obviously must demonstrate good discriminating power between positive and negative samples. It is also necessary to determine where to set the cutoff. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves are often used for this purpose. A method for using SAS ® to expedite this task is presented.",PAPER219.pdf

"ABSTRACT This paper presents a forecasting model which analyzes and projects emissions for an electric CO 2 utility. The linear spline regression model is used to forecast emissions. The model is written on SAS CO 2 which includes Base SAS ® , SAS/AF and SAS/STAT. The forecast model and the SAS/AF application, discussed in this paper, may be one tool that could be used to predict emissions and therefore to help CO 2 take necessary measures for their reduction. INTRODUCTION Forecasting an electric utility's emissions will play CO 2 a significant role in estimating the future magnitude and highlighting the temporal growth behavior of its CO 2 emissions. Considering the contribution level (50%) of to the global warming and therefore the need for CO 2 taking necessary measures, it is needless to say the importance of estimating electric utilities' CO 2 emissions for the years to come. The periodic magnitude of emissions of an electric utility CO 2 changes, depending on its periodic electricity generation, the type of fuel used for generation and the environmental activities. The sudden alteration in the growth behavior of a utility's emission activities CO 2 due to energy and environmental changes such as the Clean Air Act Amendment (CAAA) of 1990, the Energy Policy Act of 1992 and so on, may be derived from the available historical time series of its emissions. A CO 2 forecasting model which can measure and estimate the temporal growth behaviors of historical emissions CO 2 and forecast their patterns into the future in a logical manner, is necessary for this purpose. Different researchers have shown empirically that linear spline is one of the useful methods in measuring and projecting the observed characteristics of a time series (Islam, 1995) This paper presents a forecasting model which analyzes and predicts emissions for an electric CO 2 utility. The concept of assessing time variant linear trends in annual economic data series is considered in the model (Feyziogl",PAPER224.pdf

"P-value is a key criterion for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of new drugs in clinical trials, particularly in comparative studies. However, p-values are generally not presented in data summary tables generated with SAS software, because of the complexity of incorporating p-values into a formatted table that contains summary statistics, such as mean, proportion, or standard deviation. The purpose of this paper is to present a practical approach to create summary tables containing p-values which are calculated using customized SAS macros developed at STATPROBE, Inc. Three major types of SAS macros are presented in this paper to calculate p-value, according to whether variables are categorical (Fisher's exact test, Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel procedure, or logistic regression), quantitative (t-test, Wilcoxon rank-sum test, or general linear models), or survival (parametric or nonparametric estimates). SAS statistical procedures, such as PROC FREQ, PROC NPAR1WAY, PROC CATMOD, PROC GLM, and PROC LIFETEST, provide the function part of the macros. The output locations of p-values from SAS statistical procedures are also considered for the purpose of effective creation of the macros and generation of the summary tables.

"PROC DATACHK Revisited: The DATACHK Macro Jeffrey M. Abolafia University of North Carolina Introduction PROC DATACHK, a SUGI Supplemental Library procedure in Version 5 of the SAS@ System, provided a useful method for quickly checking numeric data in a selected SAS data set. For each numeric variable, PROC DATACHK listed the number of nonmissing observations, the number of missing observations, the five lowest values, the five highest values, and the number of observations having six prespecified missing values. While this information is available in PROC UNIVARIATE, a major advantage of PROC DATACHK was t~at output was presented concisely: one line per variable. With the release of Version 6 of the SAS System, the SUGI Supplemental Library procedures were discontinued. Since that time, a new procedure to replace PROC DATACHK has not been developed. The DATACHK macro attempts to simulate PROC DATACHK. Like PROC DATACHK, the DATACHK macro was developed to quickly check numeric variables in a selected SAS data set. For each numeric variable, DATACHK concisely lists the number of nonmissing observations, the number of missing observations, the five lowest values, and the five highest values (the DATACHK macro does not list the six prespecified missing values) . Usage The macro DATACHK contains two keyword parameters: DATA The name of an existing SAS data set. This can be a permanent or work data set. YOU can specify a one or two level name. This parameter is required. VAR A list of numeric variables separated by spaces. If the VAR parameters not specified then all numeric variables are processed. This parameter is optional. Below are two example of using the macro DATACHK. Example 1 uses the macro without the optional VAR parameter. Example two invokes the macro using the VAR parameter. %DATACHK(DATA=IN .FINAL) %DATACHK(DATA=IN.FINAL,VAR=LDL HDL AGE) Printed Output The DATACHK macro prints the following information for each numeric variable in a selected SAS data set:",PAPER229.pdf

"quired a programmer to edit several jobs each month to speci~ the correct fiscal years and month for the report. Editing this monthly job required considerable time and was very prone to errors. There were numerous occurrences where the value of a variable or the variable name had to represent a specific fiscal year or a month. For example, some reports needed values for a variable to be FY96 or FY95. Others needed variables named Ju195 and Ju196. Titles were required that read FY 96 vs. 95 or Summary for March 96. This paper shows how to use date functions and macros to set all these values without editing a single job. OVERVIEW Example 1 the values that were being changed each month.

"emorial Hospital, Rochester, New York ABSTRACT: The Quality Reporting System (QRS) was designed to measure and monitor quality of services and resource utilization within Strong Memorial Hospital. Fifteen indicators for nine departments were initially identified to be followed. Each indicator for each department required a statistical process control chart (SPC), an interpretation section and a comment section. To reduce the amount of paper required to produce the report it was decided to consolidate the three parts of the report onto a single piece of paper per department indicator. This was accomplished by using the GREPLAY procedure to combine a Shewhart plot, an interpretation section and a workspace section into a single graphics output. The ANNOTATE FACILITY was used to create the interpretation and comment sections and to enhance the display of out of control points on the Shewhart plot. INTRODUCTION: The intent of the QRS was to monitor key outcomes measures for quality of services and resource utilization. Indicators include length of stay, mortality and readmission rates, volumes, customer satisfaction and cost measures. The data is plotted monthly and the report is distributed quarterly. The report needed to deliver a lot of information but in a concise and simple to understand format. To keep the size of the report to a minimum we limited the report to one sheet of paper per indicator per department. Each sheet of paper was divided into three sections using a SAS/",PAPER233.pdf
"ct This paper presents a SAS/AF application which allows you to sample an existing SAS data set using three common sampling techniques. You may also produce estimates of a population mean and its associated standard error. These estimates use the appropriate statistical sampling theory to adjust for population and sample sizes. Introduction In many applications SAS users are faced with very large data sets. Sampling can be used in these situations to provide smaller, more manageable data sets. Although the SAS System provides many tools that can be used for sampling these data sets, there is not a single procedure or Institute provided application for doing this. You are responsible for pulling these tools together. Also, SAS statistical estimation procedures such as PROC MEANS are only applicable for simple random samples from large data sets. For more complicated sampling techniques, you must write your own estimation programs. The SAS/AF Frame application presented here addresses these two issues. First, the application provides an easy to use interface for sampling an existing SAS data set. Three common sampling techniques are provided: simple random sampling, stratified random sampling and cluster sampling. Secondly, the application allows the user to estimate the population mean of a variable of interest using the appropriate formulas based on the sampling technique and adjusted for the population and sample sizes. A flow diagram of the application is shown in Figure 1.",PAPER234.pdf
"Manipulating Clinical Research Data with the TRANSPOSE Procedure in SASIASSIST@ Software Stanley Cron, Center for AIDS Research, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, Texas INTRODUCTION The analysis of clinical research data occasionally presents problems due to the arrangement of variables in the data set. One common dilemma involves obtaining a frequency distribution for a multiple response item on a data collection form. This type of variable is typically represented by several variables in a data set, i.e., one variable for each response blank on the form. A complete frequency distribution of all responses or values for the multiple response item necessitates that these variables be combined into one variable. Another common problem involves analyzing repeated measurements that are contained in a single variable. Comparisons between time points usually require that each group of time point measurements be a separate variable. The Transpose a SAS Data Set option in SAS/ASSIST software can be used to solve both of these problems. Variables representing multiple responses or observations can be collapsed into one variable containing all of the observations. In addition, a single variable containing repeated measurements can be divided into multiple variables. This poster will demonstrate the use of the TRANSPOSE Procedure in SAS/ASSIST to rearrange data from two studies of patients with HIV infection. It is most appropriate for those persons in clinical research who are novice users of SAS@ software. One example will focus on a data set used for a fungal culture results form, in which ten variables are used to enter all of the fungal organisms identified for a particular subject. The second example consists of a small data set of laboratory values that are gathered over a series of time intervals.

"Multiple-response data from survey questionnaires where questions have the instruction ""check all that apply"" present a challenge to the SAS® software programmer. For a simple question, the answer may be either A or B; the sum of percent response is 100%. For the series of variables in a multiple-response question, the answer may be both A and B; because response rate for each variable in the series is dependent upon the other variables, the sum of the percent response may be greater than 100%. This paper examines the SAS software proc FREQ output data set and discusses the construction of a standardized data set containing frequency of response information for multiple-response data for graphics presentation. The CHECKALL macro takes as parameters an output data set name, and a list of the multiple-response variables. The output data set contains the variable names and labels of the multiple-response variables. This data set is used by the SHOWCOMB macro to report the frequency of  combinations of response.

"the final product is one goal of a hot steel rolling mill. Normal wear of equipment occurs during the rolling process. Replacing rolling equipment while completing a customer order can introduce variation. This paper discusses one method of monitoring variation that could be introduced as a result of changing rolling equipment. INTRODUCTION Hot steel is formed or rolled by forcing it between two cylindrical objects called rolls. The final shape of the product is determined by the shape or contour of the rolls. This shape or contour is commonly referred to as a pass. Typically, there are several passes in each roll. The product created in this discussion is rails. Rails are created fkom raw material called steel blooms. Blooms are rectangular and have a length sticient to produce the final product. The bloom is heated between 1500-2000 degrees Fahrenheit and then put in contact with a set of rotating rolls. The rotating rolls pull the bloom slowly through the first pass. Since the steel is very hot, it is soft and allows itself to be shaped. The passes in the first group are called roughing passes and are contained in rolls referred to as the roughing set. As the steel progresses through these passes, the general shape of a rail starts to appear. The final shape of the rail is created by a series of passes contained in rolls referred to as the finishing set. Normal wear in the passes occurs due to the high forces of rolling and the high temperature of the steel. When it i",PAPER237.pdf

"1 BASIC AND ADVANCED USES OF SASDATES Kenneth L. Goodwin, Inland Steel Company Introduction In my current position, I am frequently asked to retrieve and report on information by date, whether it is to give summaries by ship week, report production for a given week, or produce charts for annual reporting. I have found numerous methods for employing SASdates to accomplish these tasks, including using them to reduce or eliminate the need for date-related program maintenance. This paper will explain SASdates and their basic uses,   plus illustrate some more advanced ways to utilize them to accomplish common tasks more efficiently. The Basics of SASdates SASdate Structure The SAS 1 System can read, write, and work with values that represent dates. These ""SASdates"" are values based on the number of days before or since January 1, 1960. Figure 1 shows the corresponding SASdates for some sample dates. The use of a sequence number to represent a date is not unique to SAS. Other software packages such as FOCUS 2 and LOTUS 1-2-3 3 also utilize this concept. The starting date used is different but the usage is very similar. When I first learned of this representation for dates it seemed unusual, but as I began to use SASdates their power became very apparent. They enable you to make date comparisons very easily without having to worry about year turnover, leap year adjustments, new centuries, etc. Through the use of the many date functions, you can use all or part of the date as needed, and you can utilize the various date formats to ease date output. Additionally, you can subgroup dates with formulas instead of employing a long series of IF statements. Getting the Date In The first step is to transform the date from the format in which it is stored to a SASdate value. This can be done in many ways, three of which are explained here. The first method is to use one of the date INFORMATs in an INPUT statement, reading in the dates from input records. Figure-2 shows some sample d",PAPER240.pdf
"In order to assess the reliability of a given characterization of a subject it is often necessary to obtain multiple readings, usually but not always from different individuals or raters. The degree of agreement among the various raters gives some indication as to the consistency of the values. If agreement is high, we feel more confident the ratings reflect the actual circumstance. If agreement among the raters is low, we are less confident in the results. While several methods are available for measuring agreement when there are only two raters, this paper concentrates on presenting a generalized implementation of the Fleiss (1981) technique. This method can be utilized even in situations where there are more than two raters and/or categories. A review of the statistical theory behind the intraclass correlation coefficients and kappa statistics obtained when looking at the above situations is presented.

"1 Figure 1 : Data/ Information Loop Successful Business Intelligence Systems: Improving Information Quality with the SAS System ® W. Droogendyk, Dofasco Inc., Hamiliton, Ontario, Canada L. Harschnitz, Dofasco Inc., Hamilton, Ontario, Canada Introduction Dofasco Inc. manufactures flat rolled steel products, combining traditional Basic Oxygen Furnace, and Electric Arc Furnace technology at  our Hamilton, Ontario plant with minimill technology at our joint venture plant in Gallatin, Kentucky. Over the past decade, wherever possible, Dofasco has been managing by data and information, rather than by intuition and experience. We have begun to treat data as a corporate asset, and realize that information can provide a competitive advantage. We have also become aware of how data moves through the business to become available as information. Figure 1 shows this pictorially. We consider both our Operational Data Stores, and our Data Warehouse to be business intelligence systems. Both address the user need for connected, accessible, meaningful, and complete data. The Data Warehouse also has the characteristics of being static, disconnected from Operational Stores, and containing external data if required. From Figure 1 it can be seen that while information is extracted from the business intelligence systems, information quality must be built into the operational databases. Therefore, successful business intelligence systems begin with a rigorous Information Quality Program at the Operational level. Also, it can be seen that any information quality program becomes a joint endeavour between business groups and those responsible for the information systems. This paper is an overview of our journey from recognizing and attacking data integrity problems to the development of an Information Quality Program, and some practical examples of leveraging the power of the SAS System to get there and ® stay there. 2.0 Information Quality The mission of an Information Quality Program is to m",PAPER243.pdf

Dixon, Dixon Associates, Los Angeles, CA ABSTRACT This paper describes a microcomputer, SF36.EXE, that generates SAS® code for scoring one of the most widely used measures of health-related quality of life today, the SF-36 TM  Health Survey. The SF-36 TM Health Survey measures eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions. The generated SAS code derives the 8 SF-36 TM scales as well as the SF-36 TM physical and mental health composite scores. In addition, the program produces code that provides US general population normative scores, age and gender adjusted to ones sample.    The significance of the difference between the sample and the general population on each SF-36 TM scale score is also generated. Example input and output files are included. SF-36 TM and SF-36.EXE The SF-36 TM taps eight health concepts: physical functioning, bodily pain, role limitations due to physical health problems, role limitations due to personal or emotional problems, emotional well-being, social functioning, energy/fatigue, and general health perceptions.

"fornia, USA ABSTRACT A customized SAS/AF application was developed to facilitate the design of a large research database which has to be applicable in three software systems. This paper gives an overview of this innovative SAS application, as it is related to the project work requirements. SAS automation organized and improved the efficiency and accuracy of this database design task. INTRODUCTION An international multi-center clinical research project is being conducted at Ischemia Research and Education Foundation (IREF) to study heart surgery patients in over 60 medical centers. Its in-hospital data collection tool is a questionnaire or Case Report Form (CRF) that is over 100 pages in length. In addition, three other questionnaires collect follow-up information about the patients after they are discharged from the hospital. Based on various considerations, a portable customized Microsoft Visual Basic data collection system will be used to capture the data at the study sites. The data entry screens will be linked to a Microsoft Access database. The Access data from the field sites will be transferred to and warehoused in an Oracle ® Data Management System at IREF. Eventually, the study data will be extracted from the Oracle database to the SAS System for reporting and statistical analyses. These research data will flow through three software systems. A database must be designed and created for each of these systems by programmers in these respective groups. Designing a SAS",PAPER245.pdf

"This simple, yet highly useful SAS® program generates a ""relational map"" of permanent SAS datasets or SAS/ACCESS® views within a common libname reference. Basically, RDB_MAP.SAS produces a tabular or matrix report showing the common variables shared by all the datasets or views in the libname. The column headings of the report are the SAS dataset or view names and the row headings are all the SAS variable names. An 'X' (or your favorite alpha-numeric character or word) is printed under the dataset or view the variable is found. One can then easily see which tables share a common variable. RDB_MAP.SAS utilizes the SASHELP.VCOLUMN dataset , a PROC SORT, a PROC TRANSPOSE, and a simple PROC PRINT.

"The data modeling in banks or insurance companies often requires data files to travel from or to other companies. Some data fields, such as credit card numbers and social security numbers, while necessary to be included in the file, need to be unknown to other companies. Encryption is a way to do this by replacing original characters in the file by some other characters that make no sense. Annette I. Ladan had an excellent discussion of the keyless encryption algorithms in SAS, at the SUGI 20 Conference. This paper tries to extend the subject further to algorithms of the keyed encryption in SAS. A special effort is made to discuss bitwise operations and SAS newly added bitwise functions, as well as the pseudo bitwise operations that authors used before SAS bitwise functions came out. A sample SAS program and its result are also displayed. Although the discussion is based on results from UNIX system and ASCII data, the algorithms and sample SAS program can be applied to any operating system and any type of data.",PAPER248.pdf

"is important in the meaningful transmission of information. Organizations depend on these forms to rapidly signal their purpose and content to those responsible for their review. However, it can be burdensome to the reporting agency to record data on these forms. Some of this burden can be alleviated by the automatic retrieval of data to printers that can complete pre-existing forms. There is a danger of loss of alignment of the form in the printer so that values may be misplaced. This would not be the case if the form and its contents were created atthe same time. elements that cannot be combined easily using line- printer capabilities. Various sizes and styles of type face may be used, reverse colors and company logos as well as lines in different locations and orientations can exist on one form. The reproduction of these forms can be accomplished by the use of graphics, producing desktop publishing quality output. With the introduction of the Data Step Graphics Interface (DSGI) in the SAS@ system this is now possible.

In the past couple of years, we have experimented using SAS/INSIGHT ® and JMP ® as the tool kits for carrying out the analysis covered in these courses. In this paper we are going to concentrate on the advantages and disadvantages of each in carrying out analysis, gaining insight in terms of the models being fitted and understanding better the results of the fit.   We have found that both SAS/INSIGHT and JMP were excellent exploratory and analytical tools. They both helped students discover more, interact more and understand more as compared to previous years when students only used SAS ® , SAS/STAT ® and SAS/GRAPH ® to perform these same analyses.   In addition, we have found that both were better for checking the assumptions of the various models fitted and easier in the graphical presentation of the final results.

"atistics Mary Ann Bush, National Center for Health Statistics Ilene Gottfried, National Center for Health Statistics Dawn M. Scott, National Center for Health Statistics 1 ABSTRACT The 1985 National Nursing Home Survey and Followup collected data on a national probability sample of 11,181 persons living in nursing homes in 1984 and 1985. For each person, data included up to 103 admission-discharge date pairs describing stays in nursing homes and hospitals. Dates were not collected in chronological order and were collected from several sources. Thousands of dates were incomplete and hundreds of reported stays conflicted with one another. The first challenge in organizing this data is making it sensible: imputing missing portions of dates, correcting conflicts, and maintaining markers for stays with too little information for imputation. The second challenge is presenting the data so they can be easily used for varied analyses and still account for variations in nursing home discharge policies. The task would be almost intolerable without the powerful, easy to use SAS® date functions. In combination with the use of SAS Views®, these functions allow us to build an analytical file that will be valuable for research in long-term care utilization.

"Creating Client-Friendly SAS Output Arthur C. Singer, Wyeth-Ayerst Research, Philadelphia, PA Caroline M. Bobik, Bobik Consulting, Inc., Paoli, PA The most important goal of creating computer output is presenting concise communication in the shortest time, remembering that Time is money. This poster presentation will emphasize readable annotation in tabular output. Appropriate documentation decreases the time spent with the client explaining the computer- generated information. SAS@I programmers/users may find this approach helpful in dealing with clients who are not versed in computer-coded arguments. Sorting of data by meaningful categories is often a neglected concept. In our experience, we have frequently received final listings of clinical results that were output in no apparent order and were virtually unusable. A user/programmer and the client should agree on the end format before data processing begins, SAS@ Software provides the tools necessary to produce such output. This presentation will display the transition from Microsoft Excel@ output through SAS default output to easily read SAS output. Displays of SAS software output will be used to illustrate the concepts relevant to this topic. The emphasis is on the content of the output rather than the syntax used to produce it. Programmers/users have different levels of expertise with some writing syntax more elegantly and efficiently than others. A sampling of 25 representative observations is used to show a progression of improvements, with possibly a blunder or two, to a data set. We were given a Microsoft Excel file made up of 4 sheets (tables). The sheets contained demographic, chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis data, ail constructed based on typical observations.

"The interactive effects of two anticancer agents are frequently evaluated using three different types of graphs: concentrationeffect curves, isobolograms, or combination index curves. In order to determine the cytotoxicity of the combined agents at an array of combinations, the experimental cytotoxicity data are usually processed by using statistical software and spreadsheet software separately. In general, the use of separate software applications is time-consuming and introduces the risk of errors made during data transfer. To avoid these pitfalls, we developed a SAS based system that processes the raw cytotoxicity assay data and generates three types of graphs and related parameters. The system consists of a series of SAS macros that can be   structured in three levels (menu program, main flow macro, and individual function macros) and classified into three categories (data manipulation, model estimation, and graph presentation). Three curves are generated using SAS/GRAPH. It is efficient and convenient for researchers to this system to measure the interactive effects of combinations of two anticancer agents.",PAPER259.pdf

"In.]ine or process specification limits are used in semiconductor processes to provide some level of assurance for product conformance that is measured at the end of wafer fabrication. However, these limits are not always set in a rigorous manner and may not prove to be an adequate in- line screening method for good and bad circuits. In this paper, an alternative way for engineers to release equipment or product for production will be explored. This approach uses a probability measure to predict how likely it is that the device will be good at functional testing based upon its in-line measured characteristic. This probability is obtained using the predictions from a linear regression equation. The Gibbs sampler is then used to construct a 100( 1a)% credible band around the predicted probabilities. These techniques will be demonstrated using data from a semiconductor wafer anneal process. Also, it will be shown how the SAEP system for the personal computer can be used to implement this technique.",PAPER264.pdf

The rule in- volves accepting the null hypothesis when a confidence interval for either mean overlaps the other mean, and rejecting the null hypothesis otherwise. In some cases with moderate to high sample sizes and/or similar-sized confidence intervals, the original confidence intervals need to be extended before the null hypothesis can be rejected by the rule. The rule is most easily applied when the means and confidence intervals are displayed with auxiliary information that includes the degrees of freedom and potential extensions to the confidence interval bounds. To display results in this manner, a SAS macro utilizing the annotate facility with the SAS GPLOT procedure is provided.",PAPER270.pdf
"The New ADX Interface for Design and Analysis of Experiments Sharad S. Prabhu, Robert N. Rodriguez, and Randall D. Tobias SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC 27513 Introduction The ADX environment provides a point-and-click interface for designing and analyzing standard experiments that is intended primarily for quality engineers, researchers, and other non-statisticians. Support is provided for construction of two-level designs, response surface designs, designs for Taguchi applications, mixture designs, and optimal designs. The new interface described in this presentation is more intuitive, offers greater customization of results, and provides a desktop for viewing and organizing designs, as well as a journaling facility. Interactive graphics have been added to facilitate analysis and optimization, and new plotting techniques such as profile plots have been incorporated. For more advanced users, the new ADX interface offers direct interfaces to the FACTEX and OPTEX procedures. Invoking the ADX Software When you invoke the ADX interface you first see the ADX desktop with the icons representing any designs that you previously constructed and saved. The ADX desktop provides a placeholder to organize and view the designs. You can copy a design, view a design summary, or export a design to a data set from the desktop. The following example illustrates how a design is constructed and analyzed using the ADX interface. Example This example comes from a wafer production facility in the semiconductor industry. The objective of the experiment is to improve the process of growing an epitaxial layer on polished silicon wafer used in IC fabrication. Five factors that affect the process performance were selected, and two levels of each factor were chosen. The response variables are layer thickness (THCKNESS) and layer resitivity (RESTIVTY).

"Segmentation Using Decision Trees Dominique Latour Padraic Neville Statistical decisions trees techniques such as CART (classification and regression trees) and CHAID (chi-squared automatic interaction detection) have become increasingly popular methods for customer segmentation and profiling. These techniques are attractive because they are easy to interpret and provide a great flexibility as they will handle both discrete and ordinal inputs and outputs. A component of the SAS Data Mining solution is an easy and flexible interface to CART and CHAID that can be used for prediction, clustering, and classification. In this presentation, we review these methodologies. Using a case study we demonstrate the powerful and flexible features of the application and compare its use to other data mining techniques such as neural network and logistic regression.

"gon State University Abstract P-values and confidence intervals given by the MIXED procedure are often based on asymptotic properties and may not be accurate for small sample sizes. This paper describes a simple adjustment to the signed square root of the log-likelihood ratio statistic yielding a test that can be very accurate for small samples. This adjustment, based on recent results in higher order asymptotics, is readily obtained in SAS with PROC MIXED and ® SAS/IML . ® Introduction SAS/STAT offers several methods for obtaining p- ® values and confidence intervals in mixed linear models. Standard asymptotic tests provided by the MIXED procedure include the Wald test and the likelihood ratio test (LRT). SAS also offers specialized approximate and exact tests for some mixed linear models. For testing certain hypotheses in variance component models, for example, the GLM procedure gives exact p-values when the data is balanced and p-values based on the Satterthwaite approximation when the data is unbalanced. The likelihood based tests are appealing because they offer a general method for obtaining p-values and confidence intervals. However in some settings, both the Wald test and the LRT can have poor small sample properties when compared with specialized approximate tests. For a comparison of the Wald test and the specialized Hotelling-Lawley-Pillai-Samson trace statistic in   repeated measures models see Wright (1995).

"Traditional formulae for standard errors and subsequent statistical significance tests implemented in various popular statistical packages are based on the premise that the data are a simple random sample (SRS) of observations from a superpopulation. Equivalently, the observations are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (IID). For complex analytic surveys, these assumptions are almost always invalid leading to potentially incorrect inferences due to the failure to adjust relevant standard errors of the parameters. Here, we concentrate on binary responses where a logistic regression analysis would be meaningful and introduce a SAS ® macro, LOGITSE, that takes the cluster-correlated nature of the complex survey design into account, thus providing for correct inference.",PAPER275.pdf
"Six surgeons perform over 800 CABG surgeries at Memorial Mission Hospital each year. Surgeon specific results are evaluated quarterly. Each surgeon is compared to the remainder of the group for seven adverse events with the intent of identifying continuous quality improvement (CQI) opportunities for clinical practice. In order to drive out fear in the CQI process, the probability of declaring a false significance must be controlled. Adjustment techniques to address the multiple comparisons problem are available (e.g. Bonferroni, Sidak) but may prove too conservative to identify CQI opportunities for the surgeons. Therefore, a method that balances the risk of falsely declaring a significant result with the ability to detect clinically important differences is desirable. We have employed PROC MULTTEST to resample the data to make permutation adjustments. This method approximates the distribution of the minimum p- value of all tests and this distribution is then used to adjust individual raw p-values.

A clinical trial for a new treatment of psoriasis may involve repeated measurements of symptom severity. clustering, where measurements are taken on subjects that share a common category or characteristic that leads to correlation. Incidence of pulmonary disease among family members may be correlated because of hereditary factors. The correlation must be accounted for by analysis methods appropriate to the data.

"The analysis of correlated data arising from repeated measurements when the measurements are assumed to be multivariate normal has been studied extensively. In many practical problems, however, the normality assumption is not reasonable. When the responses are discrete and correlated, for example, different methodology must be used in the analysis of the data. Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) provide a practical method with reasonable statistical efficiency to analyze such data.

Emphasis is placed on discrete correlated data, since this is an area of great practical interest.",PAPER278.pdf
"called balanced replicated subsampling for assessing error variances from complex survey samples is implemented in SAS software. Methods for structuring data files and SAS macros for calculations are discussed. The methods are illustrated with data on livestock ownership, school attendance and children's health, including incidence of malaria, from a survey in rural Zimbabwe. INTRODUCTION Most practical household surveys do not use the simple random samples that are discussed in our statistics texts and programmed into the analyses done by our statistical software. Practical survey sample designs involve elements of clustering, stratification and systematic selection that introduce sources of variation that are not accounted for in the theory of simple random samples. Cluster sampling is the random selection of groups or clusters of cases and the subsequent measurement of all or samples of their members. Observations within clusters are generally more homogeneous or similar to each other than randomly selected observations. So error is introduced into estimators beyond that from sampling individual observations. Stratification potentially reduces the variability of estimators by sampling independently from groups known to be more homogeneous than the whole population being sampled. Systematic sampling is the method of selecting one in n observations from a list. It is equivalent to simple random sampling if the list itself in random order.

"nic, Rochester, MN Suresh Nair, Geisinger Clinic, PA Abstract This paper brings together a variety of graphical and analytic tools used in the analysis of two-period crossover clinical trials for continuous data. SAS/GRAPH@ is used to construct exploratory analyses for carryover, period, and treatment effects. A number of different SAS@ procedures carry out various alternative inferential approaches to crossover studies. Introduction Two-period crossover designs are common place in clinical trial research (1 ,2). A crossover trial is a trial in which subjects are given sequences of treatments with the objective of s~dying differences between treatments. The most common crossover design is the two-period crossover study where subjects randomly receive one of two treatments and are later crossed over to receive the other treatment (1,2,3). There are several advantages of crossover trials over parallel group studies (1,2,4). Each patient acts as IMher own control. There is an evaluation of both treatments for each patient, so treatment differences can be based on within-patient comparisons instead of beWeen patient comparisons. Secause there is usually less variability within a patient than between patients, there is usually an increase in precision and therefore a decrease in required sample size for a study to detect the same specified effect size. The disadvantages of using a crossover trial include a greater inconvenience to patients because they are required to submit to mu",PAPER280.pdf

"GETTING STARTED WITH PROC LOGISTIC Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. Introduction Logistic Regression is an increasingly popular analytic tool. Used to predict the probability that the event of interest will occur as a linear function of one (or more) continuous and/or dichotomous independent variables, this technique is implemented in the SAS@ System in PROC LOGISTIC. This paper gives an overview of how some common forms of logistic regression models can be implemented using PROC LOGISTIC as well as important changes and enhancements to the procedure in Releases 6.07 and above of the SAS@ System. Background Logistic regression is commonly used to obtain predicted probabilities that a unit of the population under analysis will acquire the event of interest as a linear function of one or more: l continuous-level variables . dichotomous (binary) variables l or, a combination of both continuous and binary independent variables. Many concepts in logistic regression will be familiar to people who already have experience with simple and multiple regression models. In fact, much of the syntax in PROC LOGISTIC will be familiar to SAS System users already experienced with using PROCS REG and/or GLM. In logistic regression, however, the dependent variable is dichotomous and is usually coded as: l zero (event did not occur) l one (event did occur) for each particular subject in the data set upon which the analysis will be carried out. The logistic function is used to estimate, as a function of unit changes in the independent variable, the probability that the event of interest will occur. This function is often called the link function in that it connects, or links changes in values of the independent variables to increasing (or decreasing) probability of occurrence of the event being modeled by the dependent variable. Implementation in the SAS Svstem Techniques for implementing logistic regression are found in PROC LOGISTIC in the STAT module of SAS System",PAPER283.pdf

"CHARACTERIZATION OF VARIANCE IN MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS: ANALYSIS OF USUAL DATA John A. Wass Abbott Laboratories Abbott Par& IL Introduction A variety of diverse data sets are of- fered to the industrial statistician in order to characterize variability in reagents and instrument systems. Many times this data contains puta- tive outliers, missing data, augmented data or so-called equivalent data. To generate estimates of variability the analyst must fust deal with these minor problems before proceeding to the major analytic fictions. For the examples contained herein we will address outliers, missing data and equivalent data. In the medical diag- nostics industry addressing the above may be as simple as calculating vari- ances for complete data sets, or as non-trivial as characterizing the vari- ance components from a variety of sources. The SAS system offers a number of ways of accomplishing this and the analyst must be aware how the design and source characteri- zations affect the choice of statistical tools. A Sample Data Set Our sample data set (Table 1.) comes from a single control level of a standard clinical chemistry analyte. These data are collected on automated clinical ana- lyzers that can repetitively sample and randomly access any given sample cup in a multi-sample carousel. Any given repetitive sample of a given cup is called a rep while the sum of all reps on that sample constitutes a run. The analyte is aliquoted into three separate sample cups, all of which are repetitively sampled so there are three runs per instrument. Alternatively, 3 separate preparations (of the same reagent) are made and each aliquoted into 3 cups. Two instruments are run in this manner for a period of 5 days. Therefore we have, 3 reps per run, 3 runs per instrument, 2 instruments per day for fivedaysfor atotalof3x 3x2x50r90 data points. How we treat these data points will depend on what we would like to define as our experimental unit. We will first examine the data for tra",PAPER289.pdf
"Cursor Tracking In SAS/AF FRAME Applications Don Stanley Don Stanley Consulting Limited Wellington NEW ZEALAND Overview Cursor tracking is simply the ability to be able to detect the position of the cursor and automatically, i.e. without any user input, carry out processing specific to the current cursor position. Perhaps the simplest, and best known usage of cursor tracking in the PC environments is for displaying tool tips. These are small snippets of information that display when the cursor moves over some part of the screen. They tell us briefly and succinctly what will happen when the user presses a mouse button (usually the left mouse button) whilst the pointer is positioned at its current point. Cursor tracking is used extensively in the Windows 95 Operating Environment. All the automatic popping up of menu options is done by detecting the cursor position and carrying out processing based on that position. Tool tips are arguably the most obvious cursor tracking application. Tool tips are built into the SAS environment toolbars that display at the top of the screen. They can also be used in the applications we build with SAS/AF FRAME entries. In this paper I will be demonstrating the use of cursor tracking in FRAME applications. I will show how tool tips work in both the development and build environments. Two types of tool tips will be presented, those that display over the application display in a small rectangular box, and those that display in the status area. The first is built into SAS/AF FRAME region attributes and works in both the development and runtime environments, the second requires minimal code to set up and runs in the runtime environment only. After discussing tool tips I will move onto to one area where FRAME has in built cursor tracking. This is where you can modify the cursor shape.

"Two statistical procedures in SAS/ETS, PROC MODEL and PROC SYSNLIN, can be used to estimate nonlinear systems. However, it is often inconvenient for users or researchers to revise SAS code in order to add one or more new variables (or one or more equations) into some specific, common-used, and complicated nonlinear systems, such as complete demand systems. Also, it is always difficult to obtain the standard errors of some indirect parameters, which are calculated based on their nonlinear relationships with the estimated (direct) parameters of the nonlinear systems. Various customized SAS macros are developed in this paper for users to conveniently incorporate new variables into a specific nonlinear system, the Almost Ideal Demand System Model (AIDSM). The bootstrapping approach is one of SAS macros to calculate standard errors of elasticities, which are nonlinear functions of estimated parameters of the nonlinear system. The other macros can be grouped into following categories: flow control, model configuration, model estimation, and elasticity calculation. Using the customized SAS macros, the AIDSM of six commodities (including prescription drugs, physicians services, and other medical product and services) is estimated and the income and price elasticities of these six commodities are derived to demonstrate the patterns of health care spending by the U.S. households.",PAPER291.pdf
"co, Sogei Spa, Rome, Italy Fabio Zaccaria, Sogei Spa, Rome, Italy Danilo Ballanti, Sogei Spa, Rome, Italy Abstract Sogei, the Agency of the Ministry of Finance for data computing, has created, within its fiscal matters research program, a system of parameters to determine the profits, the compensations, and the volume of business made by companies, and individual in business. The parameters (also known as Indexes of Profit) are based on a methodology that determines the amount of profit a person in business would be likely to make under normal market conditions. The estimation of the parameters is calculated on the basis of the income tax returns filed with the Tax Registry (Internal Revenue), by selecting, for each economic activity, a sample of   tax payers who are economically correct based on economic conditions, and economic-accounting indexes. To construct the parameters, homogeneous groups of tax payers in the same type of business are identified. After determining the amount of profit or compensation for each group, their capacity to make profits or earn compensation is linked to other economic variables. To apply afterwards the methodology to the universe of tax payers, we use a discriminating analysis that calculates the probability that a person in business could belong to a homogeneous business group. Moreover, we determine a greater profit or compensation for each tax payer on the basis of the estimated profit, and his/her own confidence interval. The stati",PAPER292.pdf

"504 USA, (360)902-0701 ABSTRACT This paper discusses alternative methods for estimating the benefits of social programs with an application to Demand Side Management (DSM) in the utility industry. INTRODUCTION A vital issue in estimating program net impact is self-selection bias. Selection bias results from estimation on a subsample of individuals who have essentially selected themselves for estimation through their decision to participate in a particular program. Several techniques have been developed to correct for this bias, most notably a two-stage technique attributed to Heckman (1976). In the Heckman approach, a correction term is calculated from estimates in the first stage and used as a regressor in the second. While successful at correcting bias in the parameters, this approach has several shortcomings when compared to a Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML) approach. FIML estimation yields more efficient and robust parameter estimates relative to a twostage method. In addition, a computer algorithm has been developed in SAS/IML ® . by the author to perform FIML estimation on either a two or three equation system under logistic distribution assumptions. The remainder of this paper details major two-stage and Wangs FIML approaches and shows that the FIML estimation is superior in evaluating DSM program net impact.

DSTDP downsizing and the resulting need to maximize resources are necessitating the move of programmers into application development roles. Many programmer person-hours are spent on ad hoc requests for specific subsets and basic analyses on relatively static surveillance data tables. The tables currently reside on an IBM MVS mainframe. Many epidemiological and behavioral researchers and statisticians in the Division, hereafter referred to as users, frequently wished to query these tables, but were unfamiliar with the mainframe environment. Therefore, they would request a subset of tables to be downloaded to the SAS@ System for the Microsoft Windows@ environment. Realizing that these requests were prime candidates for an application, programmers began to plan for an STD surveillance data access and analysis application. Analysis and design of an STD information application (STDINFO) began in early 1996. Due to extensive experience with the SAS System, existing licenses and the functionality of SASIAFa (especially the new FRAME technology), the SAS System was the chosen development platform. In addition to application development, another need surfaced at about the same time. As sophistication of analyses i",PAPER301.pdf

"ract Many companies are looking to use the power of PC's to off-load work from their mainframes. The SAS system is ideally suited to this due to the portability of its code and data and the client/server capabilities of SAS/Connect ® . This paper will discuss how an MVS SAS batch system was converted to run on an OS/2 ® based LAN:  Over 1.6 GB of SAS data and code were transferred to a server on the LAN.  The SAS code was altered to run on the OS/2 platform.  Several thousand pages of final reports were transferred back to the mainframe for printing.  An MVS job was written that would automatically update the LAN SAS data sets from the DB2 source data. The new suite runs overnight when the LAN and network are under-utilized. The longest running job takes 4 hours to complete when run on a single PC (486 16MB). The resulting system saves over $30,000 in mainframe CPU charges per year; the analysts are more productive and prefer working interactively with SAS under OS/2.

Data collection for the study, which is already in progress, will last four years. The study is a collaboration between the National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), CDC, five field sites, and a data management contractor. Initially, data processing relied on diskettes and mainframe tapes to transfer data among field sites, the data management contractor, and CDC. Data were loaded onto the CDC mainframe and processed in a batch environment. The growth of the Internet and the availability of the SAS ® System on a UNIX workstation led to a redesign of the data processing protocol and development of the Internet-based Automated Data Management System (IADMS). File Transfer Protocol (FTP), cron scheduling, and shell scripts detect and transfer incoming data to the analysis platform, run reports, and E-mail results to data managers. Using the IADMS eliminated several manual processing steps and automated project reporting, thereby improving data management and staff efficiency.

"es you to share data between the SAS System and many other Windows applications, including Microsoft Word. In this paper, youll learn how to prepare your Word documents so that the SAS System can access them, and how to write SAS code that reads data from and writes data to those Word documents. Also, youll learn how to use DDE to send commands to Word documents from your SAS session. INTRODUCTION One of  the advantages of using the SAS System under Microsoft Windows is that you can share data between the SAS System and other Windows applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and word processing applications. The SAS System supports several data-sharing mechanisms, one of which is Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). Many other Windows applications also support DDE; Microsoft Word is one of those applications. The key to using DDE with any application is to discover the hooks that the SAS System can use to access the other applications data. For Word, the hooks are bookmarks. (Another example of hooks are the row and column designators in spreadsheet applications such as Excel and Lotus 1-2-3.) So, to use DDE to share data between the SAS System and Word, you must define bookmarks in your Word document and then write SAS code that uses these bookmarks. This paper walks you through some examples of using DDE between the SAS System and Word. Once you understand the basic steps, you can modify the example code to fit your needs.

In the always growing world-wide communication, ease of access to numerous databases and environments in various national languages is now fact of life. Correctness of interpretation of language specific characters is becoming a common issue in Client/Server. This paper is addressing the special characters' translation problem and suggests the SAS ® ® Translation Products as a proven effective solution to this problem. The authors are sharing their factual experience with the audience. They are demonstrating with an actual case how complex it may be and how easy it may become. In fact, they will explain why reading a file from outer source may end up at displaying many dark squares instead of readable text. The authors are not pretending to answer all the questions that may be raised in the translation world, but will guide audience toward the correct path within the SAS solution. Intended audience: SAS programmer analysts, project leaders, application developers and end users.

Also, attention is given to tuning the use of hiperspaces within MVS (i.e. MVS5 SRM parameters). Performance gains can be astonishing with little or no work on the part of the user. Finally, specitic case study results will be given. htroduction All SAS jobs (either batch or interactive) use a WORK fik%o store temporary data for the life of the job. The WORK file is normally placed on DASD, or occasionally VfO (MVSs virtual input/output). A SAS job Wuld incur a great deal of time reading and writing data to this DASD worktile if the job manipulates a lot of temporary data. MVS tuning, in general, attempts to reduce or eliminate physical I/O to DASD since it usually constitutes the largest portion of a jobs runtime.

This paper addresses issues encountered in gaining acceptance of SAS/CPE ® from an increasing diverse audience of data users. Also visited are the difficulties of remote reporting of performance data across platforms, and across the network. INTRODUCTION SAS/CPE is rapidly becoming the premier database for analyzing IT performance, service and capacity. As it grows to support more environments, data sources and disciplines, the suite of tools we use to access and analyze the data must also grow. The number of people needing access to this data has increased until it has become impossible for the database administrator to meet their reporting needs. At the same time, the skills of these prospective SAS/CPE users are more diverse. The distribution of SAS/CPE databases onto multiple platforms, and multiple locations further complicates the task. Back in the [good | bad] old days of the glass house SAS ® was the unquestioned language of choice for Performance Management, Capacity Planning, and IS Chargeback.

However, we can become masters in the portions of the SAS System that we use. It is not enough to know the building blocks of SASthe statements, syntax, and concepts. We also need to know how to put them together to accomplish our work. This paper guides you to resources available and skills needed in order that you can learn faster and better on your way to mastering SAS and the Information Age. To become a master, you must first believe that you can. Wanting to learn, knowing how to learn and continual learning are important to becoming and being a master. Information Explosion Not having the information you need when you need it leaves you wanting. Not knowing where to look for that information leaves you powerless. In a society where information is king, none of us can afford that. Lois Horowitz Do you doubt that we are living in the Information Age? For many SUGI 22 attendees, the number one topic at this conference is data warehousing. There is a proliferation of data in the world that needs to be easily and logically stored and retrieved. As an example of the information explosion, think about this. Today's edition of the New York Times contains more information than the average 17th century Englander would encounter in an entire lifetime. Five years from today there will be twice as much information in the world. In the computer field, the doubling time is even shorter. By the year 2000, the doubling will be less than every two years. In our book, SAS Today, A Year of Terrific Tips, we listed SAS facts for 1976 and 1996. Let's just look at SAS publications. In 1976 there was one SAS manual A User's Guide to SAS 76.

This involves generating a variety of reports to fulfill the regulatory requirements of the clinical investigation of the medical device. By establishing clinical reporting templates for each of the functional aspects of Clinical Data Management, the SAS programmer can dramatically improve the efficiency of developing and generating reports. Examples of these functional reports include patient listings, patient x-ray logs, monitor site visits, monthly status reports, & reports necessary for pre market approval application. Each type of report requires different layouts due to the different objectives of the organization. By establishing a reporting template for each type, the SAS programmer can make modifications to an already verified and complete program.

"ia Services Abstract This paper considers certain fundamental issues whenever a consultant's services are needed. From the beginning, consultants and clients need to agree on several principles, set the parameters of their collaboration, and communicate clearly their expectations of the other's role. Often problems arise when either or both parties fail to set some mutually agreeable guidelines and standards of communication. The end result may be a disappointed, dissatisfied, client who may not seek consultation services in the future and a stressed, overworked consultant who may feel that her/his services are not appreciated. Finally, some random personal notes from my experiences as a SAS ® consultant working at the Information Center of a major University are presented. To Consult or not to Consult Several statistical papers (Cameron, 1969; Marquardt, 1979; Moses & Louis, 1984) as well as papers presented in earlier SUGI conferences (Marx, 1990; Stewart, 1990) have all pointed to the effectiveness and success of hiring a consultant for a business or research project. The Canadian Aspirin study is such an example of successful statistical consulting (The Canadian Cooperative Study Group, 1978).

"Ways of Learning: What the Trainer and the Student Need to Know about Learning Styles by Judy Loren, Independent Consultant Introduction What is the best method for training? What media are most effective in accomplishing the trainers goals? The learners goals? How does a manager spend a training budget effectively? Knowing the subject matter of the training will not answer these questions. Choosing a training path that will be effective requires an understanding of the learning style of the student. Understanding learning styles benefits the learner, who can choose training paths that are most likely to succeed; the trainer, who can vary presentations to reach a diverse set of learners; and the training administrator, who can choose courses that include all learners in their audience. This paper will review several proposed systems for categorizing learning styles and suggest specific training techniques that will broaden the accessibility of training courses to all learners. It will touch on ways to identify your own learning style, or your own teaching style, and provide information on how to adapt to styles that are different from yours. What is Learning Style? People seem to be born with clear preferences for certain ways of interacting with their environment, and for ways of processing information internally. Environment can play a role in strengthening these preferences or building up the effectiveness of the less preferred method. The combination of these preferences can be thought of as the individuals learning style. Learning involves taking information from the environment and processing it internally so that it can become part of the individuals repertoire. In a very broad sense, the goal of learning is for the individual to own a concept or tool, being able to use it effectively to increase her ability to pursue and reach her goals. Research is showing that matching teaching methods with the students preferred learning style increases the chances",PAPER324.pdf
"VMS environment. While the number of users has increased, the amount of available disk space has not increased proportionally. I created a BASE SAS reporting tool which has helped me monitor disk space utilization by user and by the type of file. The code is not very sophisticated, but has helped avoid numerous frustrations and delays due to full drives. Introduction I manage a group of 6 programmer analysts and provide SAS operational support for roughly 40 others.   Two years ago, this number was only 20. As the number of SAS users has continued to grow, so has the demand for disk space.   There were a few other aspects which served to make effective space management more challenging: 1. Our department implemented data warehousing on some of the same disk drives. While this served to reduce the propagation of duplicate copies of various files across the disks, the net impact was the addition of many new files. 2. Some of the disk drives were shared with SAS users in other departments. Obviously, these colleagues were busy with their own projects, and we began to find ourselves in situations where multiple projects were competing for the same disk space. 3. Although disk space has been decreasing in cost over time, additional drives were difficult to obtain. Further, one of the key factors in justifying additional space has been the department's track record in effectively managing the storage resources it already had. Clearly, the stage had been set for disk space shortages",PAPER325.pdf
"SAS programmers ofien have the responsibility of supporting the reporting requirements of the Clinical AtTairs Department of Pharmaceutical Companies. This involves interacting with department members to define the report. The SAS programmers task is to understand the request and to design the program to achieve the desired outcome.

The fm should be organized to guide the customer through a series of questions. Sections on the form should include who the request is from and the required date, the description of the SAS request with the purpose listed, the selection criteria to identifi the population and time period of the report, and the format and organization of the report along with the method of output desired. Finally, the SAS programmer should log the completion date and time.

"tzer, Social Policy Research Associates, Menlo Park, CA ABSTRACT In this paper, we offer tips to help SAS@ programmers get to know their survey data, thereby ensuring that the road to analysis is smooth. We will address techniques to prepare for a survey, track questionnaire returns, ensure accurate data input, check for data quality, and create a data analysis file. INTRODUCTION Surveys are a standard research tool used to gather data from many different types of respondents: patients, employees, consumers, students, and other diverse popu- lations. Despite the variety in the research questions to be addressed through the use of surveys, the need for clean and accurate data for analys]s is paramount. Regardless of the population to be surveyed or the types of questions to be answered, programmers face similar issues; similar strategies can be used to identify and deal with problems of missing, inconsistent, or otherwise dirty data. Before you begin analyzing your survey data, you will be involved in at least one of the following tasks: preparing the questionnaire, pretesting and fielding the survey and getting results, entering the survey data, or preparing the data for analysis. Although these tasks are usually considered to be a linear process, they are much more likely to be completed iteratively. As you become more familiar with your data, you may find it necessary to step back, reexamine your assumptions about the data, and rerun some programs given what you learned a",PAPER33.pdf

"adened in Version 6 of the SAS System. Two SAS file structures now function as SAS data sets: SAS data files and SAS data views. Both file structures can be processed as SAS data sets in DATA steps or PROC or procedure steps. This paper introduces the concept of a SAS data view, presents its advantages and disadvantages, discusses the three types of SAS data views, and compares its structure with that of a SAS data file. Defining a SAS Data View The SAS data file is already familiar to experienced SAS users because it represents what, historically, has been called a SAS data set. For example, 1982 Version SAS data sets and Version 5 SAS data sets are technically referred to now as SAS data files. This is essentially a change in terminology. The new file structure and definition in Version 6 is the SAS data view. Unlike SAS data files, SAS data views do not contain actual data. Rather, SAS data views describe data stored in other file structures. Examples of other file structures are  DB2, SQL/DS, and ORACLE tables  sequential files and VSAM files  other SAS data sets. The data the view describes are obtained when the view is processed as a SAS data set in a DATA step or PROC step. It is appropriate to refer to SAS data views as virtual SAS data sets since they represent virtual views of data. The data are obtained at run time. For example, this program prints the SAS data set SASDATA.YEAR93:    proc print data=sasdata.year93;    run; If the data set is a SAS data file, the",PAPER36.pdf
"The ability to combine different types of data from multiple hardware and software platforms is a major strength of the SAS@system. SAS has blessed information analysts with a wealth of different options for joining data values from many different data structures. Therefore, an information analyst needs to determine who (parent data structures), what (software envi- ronment), where (hardware environment), how (the tools available to perfiormthe join) and why (the required contents of the child data set) of a join in order to determine which strategy to use, This paper will discuss the joining tech- niques offered within the SAS system and give examples of their use.",PAPER38.pdf
"merging, is the most common merging technique used in SAS**. Yet, how it works is not always obvious. This tutorial shows many of the techniques nuances and subtleties, gives examples of merges where even experienced programmers have been tripped up, and demonstrates defensive programming strategies. INTRODUCTION Several times a year you hear it. It might be in a SAS users group, at the office, or in the SAS-L. What you hear goes like this: The SAS merge is a subtle thing; or Merge should be made to work better in this situation; or Be very carefid with using merge in this case because you get unexpected results! This paper is meant to clear up some of the mystery that surrounds the match-merge. It shows some interesting examples of merges where even experienced programmers have been tripped up. It also covers the basics. By the end of this paper the reader should have a strong foundation in match-merging and know how to avoid most of the basic problems programmers typically have with merge. WHAT ISA MERGE? There are many definitions for merge. All of them talk about taking two or more sorted input files and combining them into one output file. Of course, sorted means that the input files have a common key and that the records in each file are ordered according to the key field(s). Consider the following two input files, as an example.

"1 FRAME IT: THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF RAD FRAME IT: THE NUTS AND BOLTS OF RAD Marty Brown, CommScope, Inc., Claremont, NC Marty Brown, CommScope, Inc., Claremont, NC INTRODUCTION INTRODUCTION The road to finishing a quality application does not have to be a long and confusing one. With the advent of object oriented programming(OOP), that road has become much shorter and more direct. In addition to the benefits of the OOP approach, SAS/AF software has made programming the users© environment more straight forward by providing fundamental methods for several top level classes. Additionally, these methods are made available to each of their subclasses through inheritance. Methods necessary to provide functionality specific to each child class are provided at the child level. Methods needed to provide all of the routine functionality for all widgets are already included in the software. This fact alone reduces the time necessary to develop a quality application. Application design is a step by step process that consists of seven distinct elements. The following are the steps essential to the development process: + Concept Documentation + Concept Documentation + Module Design + Module Design + Screen Design + Screen Design + Functionality + Functionality + Debugging + Debugging + Documentation + Documentation + Release + Release These steps, combined with the power of the SAS/AF development environment will ensure smooth travel to top quality applications in a short period of time. The intent of this paper is to describe and discuss each step so that the reader can develop the methodology necessary to take a project from conception to release as smoothly and quickly as possible. CONCEPT DOCUMENTATION CONCEPT DOCUMENTATION The first step to successfully developing an application is to determine exactly what the application will do. Surprisingly enough, this step in the development process is most often the one left out. It is impossible to develop an application without first",PAPER4.pdf

An orgchart shows the hierarchical relationships among data items. The SAS/AF Frame organizational chart class is available with SAS release 6.11. The orgchart class entry is SASHELP.FSP.ORGCHART.CLASS. Orgchart is in the default BUILD.RESOURCE entry so it is selectable from the default Make List when building a frame entry. Orgcharts can display data from SAS data sets or SCL lists that conform to the specific orgchart data structure. In this tutorial we will be using a SAS data set as the orgchart source data. Why use the orgchart? Many databases are structured as a series of tables, but a series of two-dimensional tables related by key columns may not correspond to the way users visualize or interact with the data. An orgchart may be a more natural representation of data that are visualized as a hierarchy rather than series of tables. Fig. 1 A directory style orgchart with three levels. Some levels are collapsed as indicated by the solid rightpointing arrow. Expanded node SASHELP has two sublevels. Collapsed nodes. 2 Creating a SAS/AF Orgchart Application The orgchart class must be used within the context of a SAS/AF Frame application. You must be running the SAS system in an environment that supports the development of Frame applications.

"1 Object Interfaces Andrew A. Norton, Trilogy Consulting Corporation, Kalamazoo, Michigan INTRODUCTION Object-oriented programming can be both spooky and threatening. Actions at one spot in a program produce changes in another spot, with no apparent connection. Program modules are not fixed in place, but can be unplugged and swapped with other modules, even at run time. A simple action may entail twenty or thirty ""messages"" (similar to subroutine calls). One module may repeat a process just executed somewhere else. You might not be able to tell the difference between a variable and a function. These characteristics may be disorienting from a traditional programming perspective, but they make sense according to the goals that object-oriented programmers value: strict isolation of data elements and related code within boundaries, partitioning of problems into less complex subproblems, independence of one module from another (with controlled communications between), interchangeability of one implementation with any other which supports the same functionality, continuity of realworld concepts through analysis and design to implementation. SAS gives you the choice: you can use traditional coding techniques for your Screen Control Language programs, or mix in true object-oriented techniques to the degree you desire. The Object Technology Group at Trilogy has been adapting techniques that work in other object-oriented languages (such as Smalltalk), and we have found that these tried-and-true techniques are not only readily adaptable to SCL but solve many otherwise messy coding problems. MAKING CHANGE EASY Object-oriented programming evolved from structured programming, so let's start there. The SAS System introduced SCL methods (similar to subroutines in other languages) with release 6.07. Structured programming divides large complex programs into smaller, simpler modules. This achieves several goals: 1.  The code internal to a module can be changed without having to chang",PAPER41.pdf
"Grouping observations in a data set into subgroups according to their percentiles based on a continuous variable (expense, age, or score) and then generating statistics for each subgroup can be tedious. By applying macros appropriately, however, one can achieve greater program efficiency and error-proof results. This paper illustrates a rational process of building a data analysis tool that demonstrates the power and efficiency of macros. By describing three approaches we employed in a real life project, this paper shows how each one improves the tool as our methodology develops. Using a step-by-step illustration of macros in DATA steps and statistical procedures to solve the problem, this paper helps SAS programmers who have just begun tapping into ""mysterious"" macro programming to learn about some of the basics of macros and the rationales that led us to the results we desired. We assume that readers of this paper have a basic understanding of macros (and macro variables), do- loops, and data set manipulation procedures.",PAPER42.pdf
"ch, Portland, OR ABSTRACT The SAS@System is a powerful tool for data manipulation and analysis, but it often produces far more output than you want to read or report. Instead of scanning through a lengthy log printout looking for error and warning messages, or hand copying a few dozen figures into a table from a hundred-page output printout, let SAS do the work. This paper introduces a variety of time-saving techniques for producing concise summary reports. The key is using the PRINTTO procedure to direct procedure output to log and print files. These files are then available to the DATA step for further refinement or analysis of the results. For example, by using a data step to review the SAS log, you can create self-monitoring production jobs that print error reports when warranted. By using a DATA step to review a lengthy output file, key results can be selected to report in summary tables or to use in advanced statistical computations. Finally, using the GPRINT procedure in SAS/GRAPH@ you can add high- resolution graphics, titles and footnotes to the results. lhtTRODucTlON This paper briefly reviews the PRINTTO and GPRINT procedures, and then demonstrates how they can be used to produce concise customized reports that save time for the programmer as well as the end-user. The examples will show just a few of the many ways the SAS System can refine and summarize its results. The goal of this paper is to introduce the idea that SAS procedure output is not necesswily an end p",PAPER43.pdf
"1 &&&, ;;, and Other Hieroglyphics Advanced Macro Topics Chris Yindra, C. Y. Training Associates INTRODUCTION SAS® macros are powerful tools that can create reusable code modules to do a variety of programming tasks. A good understanding of macro variables and how macros can generate SAS statements can aid in developing better and more useful macros. This paper will address some more advanced macro features such as the use of multiple ampersands, double semi-colons and required RUN statements. REVIEW The macro language allows the SAS user to: 1.  Pass system variables to SAS code (i.e. put SYSDATE in a report TITLE). 2.  Introduce data values or variable names into SAS code at run time. 3.  Use macro variable values to selectively execute SAS code. 4.  Pass data values from one SAS step to  another (i.e. pass the grand total computed in one step to the next step to calculate the percent to total of each detail item). Assigning Macro Variables Values can be assigned to user defined macro variables in several ways. %LET allows for direct assignments.   Values can also be directly assigned through user interfaces created with Macro windows. The CALL SYMPUT function allows values to be assigned dynamically within a DATA step or SCL program. Example 1 (CALL SYMPUT): Pass the total salary to the global symbol table. DATA _NULL_;    SET IN.PAYROLL END=FINAL;    TOTSAL + SALARY    IF FINAL THEN     CALL SYMPUT(TOTSAL,LEFT(TOTSAL)); PROC PRINT DATA=IN.PAYROLL; TITLE PAYROLL REPORT; TITLE2 TOTAL SALARY : &TOTSAL; VAR SSN SALARY; RUN; Debugging tools There are several options which can aid in tracing macros and macro variable values. OPTIONS: SOURCE2 - Writes SAS code generated by                     %INCLUDE to the log. SYMBOLGEN - Writes the resolved value of macro                     variables to the log.

"E support within the SAS System for Windows Release 6.12. This support includes OLE container, OLE automation controller, and OLE automation server functionality. OLE container and OLE controller support is available in SAS/AF ® FRAME entries and SAS/EIS ® applica- tions. OLE automation server support is available with base SAS software. INTRODUCTION This paper provides an overview of the OLE support in the SAS System. For more details on OLE in general, see the documentation for the Microsoft Windows operating environment. For further details on OLE support within the SAS System, refer to the online documentation for the SAS Companion. OLE facilitates the exchange of information between applications. OLE containers include objects and controls from other applications. Through OLE automation, OLE controllers script objects in other applications. OLE servers are the applications that provide these objects. OLE functionality within the SAS System falls into three categories: basic container support, OLE automation support, and OLE controls support. Each section of this paper discusses the particular OLE feature followed by specific information about its use within the SAS System.

This paper will also discuss the importance of creating consistent user friendly interfaces and how this aids rapid application development. Techniques discussed will include creating sub-classes, composite widgets, and macros. Introduction Although there is a number of aspects involved in the rapid development of applications this paper will concentrate on:  Minimizing the code that a developer must write. This includes minimizing it to point where Frame entries can be developed without writing any code at all.  Using features within the SAS system that allow developers to find and utilise information about the local environment and dynamically adapt to that environment. Thus, making code easier to reuse and transport between operating systems.  How consistent user friendly interfaces aid the rapid development of applications. Topics discussed to reduce code include:  Writing reusable blocks of code - Macros and Methods.  Using System Files and Commands to gather Information.  Consistent Friendly User Interfaces.  Creating sub-classes of objects.

"T / INTRODUCTION The SAS ® System has numerous capabilities to store, analyze, report, and present data. However, those features are useless unless that data is stored in or can be accessed by the SAS System. This presentation will provide an overview into some of the methods that can be used to pass data into the SAS System. It will range from Base SAS's INFILE and INPUT statement to more advanced mechanisms such as SAS/ACCESS ® .  It is hoped that there will be some aspects of this presentation for the beginning, the intermediate, and perhaps even the advanced user of the SAS System. It should be noted in advance that the details of this topic can vary from operating system to operating system. This presentation will be primarily aimed at providing an overview which is independent of operating system. The reader is strongly encouraged to use this paper in conjunction with the appropriate manuals and ""Operating System Companions"" to gain a full understanding of the options available to them. SEQUENTIAL FILES The first potential source of data that we shall discuss is the sequential file. There are two steps involved with making any external data known to the SAS System. The source of the data must be defined to SAS, and the data must be subsequently passed to SAS. There are two statements in the DATA step which perform these tasks. The INFILE statement will define the data source, while the INPUT statement will move the data into SAS. The INFILE Statement An external file is",PAPER54.pdf
"1 BUILDING ON THE DEFAULT LINE: STURDY SAS/GRAPH ® CONSTRUCTION Susan J. Kenny Quintiles Inc. Research Triangle Park, NC Introduction To the new user, learning to use SAS/GRAPH software can be confusing. This is because SAS/GRAPH has many features and options that make it powerful yet at the same time can make it overwhelming.   This paper is designed to help the new user understand some of the basic features of SAS/GRAPH and how to avoid common errors. Basic Building Tools GOPTIONS Similar to system options, SAS/GRAPH has graphic options that can be used to control the graphic environment and graphic output. These options are specified in a GOPTIONS statement. Among the many graphic options that are available, the following are perhaps the most important for the beginning user. DEVICE= device-driver-name This graphic options specifies which SAS supplied device driver to use to produce the graph. The device driver name that is used in the statement must be a valid device name that SAS can find in a device catalog. By default, this device catalog is found in theSASHELP.DEVICES catalog. To determine the device driver name for your device, use the producedure GDEVICE and scan the descriptions to locate your device. For example, DEVICE=PS specifies the device driver name if you will be using a postscript device for hardcopy production. If you are working in Microsoft Windows® and wish to view your graph on the screen, you would use DEVICE=WIN. TARGETDEVICE=device-driver-name If you are working in an interactive windowing environment, you will most likely wish to see your graph on the screen as it will appear in hard copy (WYSIWYG). The device driver name that is supplied to this goption, therefore, is the name for the device where the graph will be ultimately produced. For example, if you are working under Windows but eventually will be producing your hard copy graph with a Hewlet Packard Laser Jet Series III printer, you would use the statement GOPTIONS DEVICE=WINTARGE",PAPER55.pdf
"a two-hour introduction to SAS/ASSIST. Most of the hundreds of students have been SAS novices with limited computing knowledge of any sort. SAS/ASSIST has always provided a simple and non-threatening, yet very capable, tool for using SAS and learning the language. Introduction When facing a task as daunting as using the SAS System for the first time, you want to first consider your options. One of these options is the SAS/ASSIST product -- a point and click interface that offers immediate a ccess to the SAS System. It has two distinct advantages over conventional methods of using the SAS System. First, although ASSIST does not require that you write a single line of SAS code, its a great way of learning how to write SAS code. This is because for each task that you accomplish in ASSIST, ASSIST generates a fully documented SAS program. By saving this code, a very straightforward process, you can study it later and considerably leverage your learning of the SAS programming language. Second, the up-front time cost of learning to use the SAS System with ASSIST is significantly shorter than learning to use the SAS System with conventional methods. When you use ASSIST you go straight to the work at hand and get results immediately. This tutorial covers the role of your data in the SAS System and how to translate raw data to a SAS file. We will also show you other common tasks that can be accomplished with ASSIST. We will particularly emphasize how to save the SAS code of every t",PAPER56.pdf

"As a SA.9 consultant, you often receive unfamiliar data. A first step in analyzing or reporting on the data is to familiarize yourself with the data. For small files, or only a few files, simply printing the data may suffice. As the number of files and size of each file increases, this becomes increasingly less effective. We cover several techniques to investigate large files including: checking the structure of the data sets, finding duplicate variables, determining if the data values are reasonable, finding holes (unexpectedly large numbers of missing or identical values), using formats to handle long character values, using indicator variables instead of numeric variables, and more. We also cover general strategies, such as documenting the data sets as received, documenting changes, using subsets of the data for testing, and keeping the original data sets intact. Many of these tools are useful even for cases where you cannot change the original data, since the results give you a better understanding of the data. Examples are primarily from the pharmaceutical industry, but the techniques can be useful for other types of data as well.",PAPER58.pdf
"Efficiency Ideas For Large Files J. Meimei Ma, Quintiles, Research Triangle Park, NC Andrew H. Karp, Sierra Information Services, Inc., San Francisco, CA INTRODUCTION This tutorial presents options you shou Id consider implementing when using the SAS System for handling large files. We touch on. a variety of topics and approaches, as opposed to dealing with only a few in depth. Using compression and index files are among the storage techniques covered; along with ways to plan your programming strategy to incorporate appropriate efficiency concepts. The strategies and hints discussed are directed toward programmers, data managers, project managers, and anyone else interested in cost effective solutions to SAS System programming problems. Only basic knowledge of SAS programming (DATA step and procedures) is assumed. The techniques are applicable to essentially all hardware platforms, although at times we address a few operating system-specific issues. TERMINOLOGY Efficiency Elements In considering efficiency, remember that more than one component of this concept exists. Your goal should be to balance all elements, which may often involve setting priorities differently for each situation, rather than blindly applying a stock series of approaches to every programming requirement. In other words, you must understand the specific problem you are facing from many viewpoints before you can choose the best solution for that problem. The primary efficiency elements separate into two main categories: machine and h II m a II. Machine elements include: computer processing time for calculations or data manipulations, called CPU, and processing time for reading or writing computerized information, called 1/O, for Input/ Output. Elements related to human efficiency include: programmer time, programmer experience level, and the priority attached to producing results quickly rather than inexpensively.

"SAS@ MACROS - A GENTLE INTRODUCTION FOR THE FEARFUL Ralph W. Leighton, The Hartford Insurance Group, Hartford CT 1.0 WHITHER WE GO ... The following is an abbreviated adaptation of a Beginning Tutorials presentation made at NESUG in 1995. in its original form, the papers emphasis was on introducing the SAS macro language, providing applications exam- ples as motivation. In the present version, although some of the material is the same, the emphasis is shifted to posing basic application problems which are not cleanly or easily solvable without recourse to macros or macro variables. In each of the sections, a specific application frames the discussion. Section 2.0 covers uses of global macro vari- ables in applications. These particular ones are set using the CALL SYMPUT routine. Section 3.0 discusses simple parameter driven recyclable code using a SAS macro. In sections 4.0 and 5.0 we take the next step into complexity; we incorporate into the macros some procedural syntax to vary the form of the macro-generated SAS-program code or to short-cut laborious and repetitious coding. The reader is not expected to be an expert in the use of macros. However, since this is not a pure tutorial, the pa- per does assume the reader knows what a SAS macro is and what a SAS macro variable is. 2.0 GLOBAL PARAMETERS: A BASIC USE OF MACRO VARIABLES.

"An Introduction to the DATA Step Graphics Interface Earl Westerlund, Eastman Kodak Company, Rochester, NY INTRODUCTION The DATA Step Graphics Interface (DSGI) is a component of SAS/GRAPH® software that enables you to generate graphics output from within a DATA step, macro or SCL application. It consists of low-level graphics routines that allow you to develop a custom graph, or add elements to an existing graph. This paper will describe the steps involved in creating a graph in the DATA step, from opening a session to stor- ing a graphic segment. A brief comparison of DSGI with other options for creating graphics will be given. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO USE DSGI? SAS/GRAPH software provides a set of procedures that allow you to produce a wide variety of standard graphics, including two-dimensional (XY) and three-dimensional (XYZ) plots, many kinds of business graphs, and maps. But, what if the graphic you need looks something like the following: 2 Limits A B C Summary <= 6 1.5-2.5: 6 > 2.5: 6 This is a kind of graphic we use at Kodak to evaluate the color balance of photographic materials. We wanted the ability to generate such a graph within the SAS ® System, as part of a researchers or engineers analysis. None of the standard SAS/GRAPH procedures could easily produce this, however. Our solution was to write a DSGI program. OTHER WAYS TO PRODUCE GRAPHICS IN THE SAS SYSTEM To solve our problem, we used DSGI. But there are other ways to generate graphs in the SAS System. Following is a quick review of the other ways to generate graphics, along with my opinion on their appropriate areas of use. SAS/GRAPH Procedures These are by far the easiest to use, they are the fastest, and most are flexible  within the context of the kinds of plot they are designed to generate. For example, you can create many kind of plots with the GPLOT procedure, as long as they are two-dimensional plots within coordinate axes. Another advantage of SAS/GRAPH procedures is support for BY variable",PAPER63.pdf
"rk, Pa. ABSTRACT Frame entries in SAS/AF use graphic display devices that enable application developers to easily build interfaces which permit users to point and click their way through applications. The functionality of frame entries allow end-users with limited computer experience to easily perform activities such as data entry, data processing, and data analysis/reporting. This paper briefly explains frame entry concepts and demonstrates the steps used in building a sample reporting application with frame entries. 1 INTRODUCTION are for submitting the report for processing, printing the SAS/AF frame entries allow developers to build graphicoriented applications by placing objects such as icons, push buttons and list boxes in a window with the different objects having different functions. Graphic text and text label objects display text which can not be changed by the user. Text entry objects accept user input and display information or program output.

"Introduction SAS ® software is especially rich in its assortment of functions that deal with character data. This class of functions is sometimes called STRING functions. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate some of the more useful string functions. Some of the functions we will discuss are: LENGTH, SUBSTR, COMPBL, COMPRESS, VERIFY, INPUT, PUT, TRANSLATE, TRANWRD, SCAN, TRIM, UPCASE, LOWCASE, REPEAT, || (concatenation), INDEX, INDEXC, AND SOUNDEX. Wow, did you realize there were so many string functions? Let's get started. How Lengths of Character Variables are Set in a SAS Data Step Before we actually discuss these functions, we need to understand how SAS software assigns storage lengths to character variables and what the LENGTH function does for us. Look at the following program: DATA EXAMPLE1;    INPUT GROUP $ @10 STRING $3.;    LEFT = 'X    '; *X AND 4 BLANKS;    RIGHT = '    X'; *4 BLANKS AND X;    C1 = SUBSTR(GROUP,1,2);    C2 = REPEAT(GROUP,1);    LGROUP = LENGTH(GROUP);    LSTRING = LENGTH(STRING);    LLEFT = LENGTH(LEFT);    LRIGHT = LENGTH(RIGHT);    LC1 = LENGTH(C1);    LC2 = LENGTH(C2); DATALINES; ABCDEFGH 123 XXX        4 Y       5 ; PROC CONTENTS DATA=EXAMPLE1 POSITION;    TITLE 'OUTPUT FROM PROC CONTENTS'; RUN; PROC PRINT DATA=EXAMPLE1 NOOBS;    TITLE 'LISTING OF EXAMPLE 1'; RUN; One purpose of this example is to clarify the term LENGTH. If you look at the output from PROC CONTENTS, each of the variables is listed, along with a TYPE and LENGTH. Take a moment and look at the output from PROC CONTENTS below:             The column labeled LEN (Length) is the number of bytes needed to store the values for each of the variables listed. By default, all the numeric variables are stored in 8 bytes. But, what about the storage lengths of the character variables? Look first at the two variables listed in the INPUT statement; GROUP and STRING. Since this is the first mention of these variables in this data step, their lengths will be assigned by the rules gov",PAPER66.pdf
"he basic syntax of the SQL Procedure. PROC SQL is the SAS @ Systems implementation of Structured Query Language, which is used for retrieving and updating data in relational tables and databases. PROC SQL also has substantial data manipulation and summarization capabilities. PROC SQL statements could be used to replace much traditional SAS code (DATA step, PROC SORT, and PROC MEANS steps), resulting in less programming time and greater computer efficiency. Most of the illustrative examp[es in this presentation pertain to DB2 tables which are used for tax administration purposes at the authors agency. The principles underlying each example should transfer readily to other settings. FIRST STEPS TOWARD UNDERSTANDING PROC SQL Relational Database Management Systems A relational database is an organized collection of information in which the data are arranged into a collection of two-dimensional tables, each containing one or more rows and columns, and conforming to certain rules. The data are logically related, based upon their values, and not according to some other data structure. Information in a relational database management system is managed using a specific language comprised of a small but elegant set of operators. This language is called Structured Query Language (SQL). Sometimes, I may refer to SAS data sets (SAS data files and SAS data views) as tables, to SAS variables as columns, and to observations as rows. Strictly speaking, these arent exactly the same thi",PAPER67.pdf
"1 Errors, Warnings, and Notes (Oh My) A Practical Guide to Debugging SAS ® Programs Susan J. Slaughter, University of California Extension, Davis, CA Lora D. Delwiche, IT/ANSA, University of California, Davis, CA Why a paper on debugging SAS programs? Most of the documentation about the SAS System doesnt even mention bugs, as if debugging wasnt worth talking about. This paper, on the other hand, is based on the belief that debugging is a good way to get insight into how SAS works. Once you understand      why   you got an error, youll be better able to avoid it in the future. In other words, people who are good debuggers are good programmers. Bugs can have different origins; some are accidentally built into the software by developers, others are introduced by programmers. Recently, one of the authors of this paper had a conversation about this topic with her father who is an aerospace engineer but not knowledgeable about the SAS System. The conversation went like this: Susan: Im writing about how to debug SAS programs. Father: I thought they would have gotten the bugs out of SAS by now. Fortunately, SAS Institute      has   done a good job of getting the bugs out of SAS software. Unfortunately, nobody has yet figured out how to get the bugs out of people. 1 The SAS System even fixes some mistakes made by programmers. For example, SAS has gotten so smart over the years that it is now almost impossible to get an error by misspelling a keyword. If you misspell a keyword in a SAS program, SAS will almost always figure out what you       meant to say and run the statement correctly in spite of your poor typing skills. But SAS cant fix all programming errors, so this paper discusses some of the most common bugs and how to exterminate them.                                                 1 Debugging Myself by Hayes (1995) contains an entertaining discussion of human bugs.

"SAS ® PROGRAM EFFICIENCY FOR BEGINNERS Bruce Gilsen, Federal Reserve Board INTRODUCTION This paper presents simple efficiency techniques that can benefit inexperienced SAS ® software users on all platforms. Efficiency techniques are frequently documented as follows.  Describe an efficiency technique.  Demonstrate the technique with examples. The drawback to this approach is that it can be difficult for SAS software users to determine when to apply the techniques. This paper takes an alternate approach, as follows.  Describe an application or data set.  P r e s e n t s i m p l e e f f i c i e n c y t e c h n i q u e s f o r t h e application or data set. This approach is designed to make it easier for SAS software users to determine when to apply the techniques to their application or data set. SUMMARY OF PROGRAMMING TASKS This paper presents efficiency techniques for the following programming tasks. 1. Create a SAS data set by reading long records from a flat file with an INPUT statement. Keep selected records based on the values of only a few incoming variables. 2. Create a new SAS data set by reading an existing SAS data set with a SET statement. Keep selected observations based on the values of only a few incoming variables. 3. Select only some observations from a SAS data set. The selected data are used as input to a SAS procedure, but are not otherwise needed. 4. In IF, WHERE, DO WHILE, or DO UNTIL statements, use OR operators or an IN operator to test if at least one of a group of conditions is true. In IF, WHERE, DO WHILE, or DO UNTIL statements, use AND operators to test if all of a group of conditions are true. 5. Select observations from a SAS data set with a WHERE statement. 6. In a DATA step, read a SAS data set with many variables to create a new SAS data set. Only a few of the variables are needed in the DATA step or the new SAS data set. 7. Create a new SAS data set containing all observations from two existing SAS data sets. The variables in the",PAPER69.pdf
"objective of the Table-driven System is to build a reliable batch application that is easy to develop and maintain. Most batch programs are treated as a black box with long lines of repetitive code that is very difficult to maintain. The Table-driven system will allow subject matter specialist to easily change system variables and values without requiring code changes. The type of batch applications, that the Table-driven System is best suited, are applications that have simple repetitive logic with different input parameters. The Table-driven System consists of three main components: a conceptual table (Edit Table), a corresponding macro code to support the conceptual table (Edit Macro), and the Code Generator Macro to piece it all together in a SAS@ Data Step. The Edit Table consists of Business Rules, and each Edit Table requires a corresponding Edit Macro to translate the business rules into SAS code. The Code Generator Macro uses both the Edit Table and the Edit Macro as input to produce a SAS Data Step with the appropriate SAS code to perform the edits. Given the present architecture, it is possible to maintain the Edit Table at a conceptual level versus code level that meets our objective.

CALL EXECUTE is a relatively new DATA step function which interacts with the SAS Macro Facility. It allows one to send character data to the macro facility for immediate macro execution during the execution of the DATA step. It was introduced in SAW3 6.07 and documented in Technical Report P-222 Changes and Enhancements to Base SAS Software. This paper gives examples showing how to use this routine and why you might want to use it. It also explains how macros invoked by CALL EXECUTE behave differently from those invoked via the standard macro call.,PAPER70.pdf
"When a new FRAME entry is created using the build window, SAS@ uses the FRAME class that is provided with SA.YAF software. Standardizing the look and feeI of an SAS/AF application is one factor that determines how intuitive an application is. Frames often have common components such as OK, Cancel, Help buttons etc. The layout and positioning of these is important to ensure uniformity across different screens of an application. Features of SAS/AF release 6.11 (aka Orlando) promote Object Oriented Application Design and allow developers to develop their own classes to ensure that visual standards are easily incorporated into an application. The SAWAF FRAME class is one object that can be subclasses to aid developing applications that have a uniform look & feel. This paper will discuss the subclassing of the FRAME class, working through an example whereon creating a new frame entry, the type of FRAME (eg dialog box) and the population of widgets in the FRAME will be demonstrated. Initializing the new FRAMEs SCL entry with a standard template will also be discussed. By subclassing the FRAME class in this manner, development time can be greatly reduced as it is not necessary to define the standard widgets and frame attribute settings each time a new frame is created. Uniformity of screens is also encouraged by initializing the screen layout. The examples in the paper will detail all the steps and code required to subclass the FRAME class. Scope This paper covers topics discussed during the 20 minute Coders Corner presentation, The basics of subclassing the FRAME class are outlined. However it is not intended to thoroughly discuss the topic. I am hoping to write an article for a future Observations@ issue which cover this topic in depth,",PAPER71.pdf
"oftware contain, in experimental form, a powerful new set of patternmatching functions, which can be used in DATA steps, macros, or SCL code. This paper provides a summary description of these new routines and includes several examples of how their use can significantly reduce the coding effort required to perform common tasks. INTRODUCTION SAS software has always contained a fairly extensive set of functions for finding particular characters within strings (INDEX, INDEXC, VERIFY) and for changing the contents of character strings in certain ways (TRANSLATE, COMPRESS, UPCASE, LEFT, RIGHT, SUBSTR on the left side of an assignment statement). New functions have been added periodically -- for instance, version 6.07 added COMPBL, TRANWRD, INDEXW, QUOTE, and DEQUOTE. Nevertheless, while these functions are extremely useful, they lack the kind of generality and expressive power that is found in some other software, such as the grep command in Unix. The 6.11 and 6.09E releases of base SAS software add two functions and three CALL routines that provide pattern matching and changing capabilities using regular expression patterns. The pattern notation allows for built- in and user-defined character classes, wild card characters, elements that are optional or occur a varying number of times, and either/or subpatterns. These functions are currently in experimental status and are expected to become production in a later release of the SAS system. They can be called from DATA steps, SCL mo",PAPER72.pdf
"Using FTP, Views, and PROC SUMM4RY to analyse large databases. Don Stanley Don Stanley Consulting Limited Wellington NE WZEALAND EM4LL: Don_Stanley@ibm. net Overview This paper discusses some techniques that have proven helpful to the New Zealand Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Corporations (ACC) recent analysis of data quality. The ACC recently undertook a project to redevelop its core computer systems. Over the last few years, many different systems that provide ACC fimctionality have been reviewed, with the result that a team, called Data Transition, was formed in early 1996 to carry out the task of analyzing existing dat~ comparing data where duplicate data was stored in several systems, modeling existing databases and developing models for an optimal database. Following the analysis, the team is also charged with the tasks of data cleaning and developing extracts from existing systems to populate new databases. I joined the data transition team at end of MAY 96 after it had been in existence for 3 months. The existing ACC systems are Fujitsu AIM databases. There are three main systems which often store similar data. For historical reasons, these 3 systems duplicate dat~ and have separate mechanisms for entering data. Interface programs run daily to keep the data synchronized, i.e. to move data from one system to the others. In addition to the AIM databases, ACC runs a SUN 4 UNIX box primarily running SAS as a data warehouse. SAS does not run on the Fujitsu, so all analysis is done on the SUN, including that discussed here. A feature of the AIM databases is their size. Some, such as the master person record, have about 3.6 million records. Much of this is duplicated in another ACC system. This is about a 700 megabyte SAS tile on the SUN. Others, such as the database that describes all medical services by person, exceed 32 million records. Another, describing medical procedures, exceeds 96 million records. These latter two files are 3.5 gigs and 7.7 gigs",PAPER73.pdf
"rogram or methodology. The SAS software systems data step and random number generating functions provide a powerful toolbox for generating data. This paper will demonstrate how to generate data for variety of situations using this toolbox. Introduction: The SAS software systems data step combined with the SORT and PLAN procedures is a powerful and useful data generation tool. Data is easily generated for simulations, for program testing, and for demonstrations. SAS has a rich set of pseudo- random number generating functions which can be used to generate data drawn from one or more populations. The combination of tools makes it possible to generate data mimicking natural population based data for many situations. Generated data is generated using a model. Models can be independent or dependent. An independent model is used to generate a datum which is drawn directly from some underlying distribution. A dependent model is used to generate a datum drawn as an element in a related series of random data. Independent data models are useful in generating single point random variables used in grouping. For example, the following code fragment will generate a treatment code with two levels: TRTGRP= INT(UNIFORM (0)+0.5) ; Independent data models are also useful to generate starting values for dependent sequences. Dependent data models can model almost any situation. Data can be generated that are time dependent such as patient weights or stock prices. They can also generate data",PAPER74.pdf

The SAS ® System provides several varieties of DO loop syntax, one in particular, the DO iterative syntax has several flavors, including DO index = list, which is especially useful if the values of the index variable are not contiguous. Unfortunately, this syntax is limited to data step processing and there isnt any equivalent to this in the macro facility   This paper will discuss how to use the SAS Macro facility to emulate the DO list statement for processing a list of character variables that can provide an application with dynamic data driven capability. It will also discuss different ways that the macro variable lists can be constructed. Several examples will be presented to demonstrate the creation of the lists, including examples that use information from the SAS Help Dictionary views, and applications that use these lists to control process flow.

How can you write a program without the need to remove a bunch of code after you are finished testing? Macros are the answer. Macros can be great tools when trying to subset data. By defining three small macros at the beginning of your program ( OAiff, OAwear, %and ), very few changes need to be made to change from one subset to another. Or you can just run the entire population from the data set. This paper will show you how to do it.",PAPER79.pdf

Macro language coding removes the necessity of maintaining a hardcoded list that might have to be modified during the reporting period, e.g., monthly, by having SAS assign each value of the independent variable to a symbolic variable, which is then resolved during the production of the graph. This eliminates the need for writing code to create each graph, resulting in a program that is shorter and easier to maintain.

"The SAS® software data step statement array V {3} $ V1V3 ('A' 'B' 'C'); produces three character variables named V1, V2, and V3 with corresponding initial values, 'A', 'B', and 'C' and a function, dim(V), which returns a value of 3. Programmers can write simple macro tools for use in larger macro procedures. These tools can duplicate SAS software data step constructions that the programmer is comfortable using and make reading and comprehension easier. The macro statement %ARRAY(V,A B C) produces three macro variables, V1, V2, and V3, with corresponding values: A, B, and C and macro variable DIM_V with the value 3. These variables can then be used in the macro iterative loop statement %DO I = 1 %TO &DIM_V.; This paper examines the SAS data step array statement and discusses the issues in constructing and using arrays of macro-variables.

"The wrap macro requires knowledge of base SAS @ software Data _NuH_ processing, SAS fimctions, and SAS Macro Language, and can be utilized anywhere that Base SAS and SAS Macro Language are available. Macro design assumes that report generation uses a DATA _Null_ to write one observation per line in multiple columns, and that some character variable values are accommodated on two lines, rather than one, within a column. The programmer can store the macro in a macro library or copy it into a program. When invoking the macro, the programmer supplies parameters, such as the width of the column, the character variable to wrap, and whether to indent the second line. If the text cannot fit within the column, the macro sets a flag to so indicate, and divides the text between two programmer-supplied variables whose length equals the column width. After filling the first variable, the macro assigns the overflow (splitting the text at a space or dash) to the second variable. The progammer uses the macro flag value to conditionally write the observation variables on two report lines, instead of one, if necessary. The macro can be invoked for multiple columns and their associated character variables within the same observation.",PAPER83.pdf
"Irene Zhao, Allergan Inc., Irvine, California SAS programmers in the pharmaceutical industry are frequently under time constraints in generating statistical tables for clinical reports. Most tables are similar in format. If we create a generic table generation program, we can greatly reduce the statistical table generating time. This paper discusses how to create generic statistical tables generating programs for clinical reports by using SAS macro techniques and the REPORT procedure (PROC REPORT). There are two major macro structures used in the provided example, a demographic table program. Each macro determines descriptive and/or inferential statistics for continuous variables and categorical variables. The statistical analysis for the categorical variables includes sample sizes, percentages and probability values (p-value) generated by the FREQ procedure, while the analysis for the continuous variables includes means, standard deviations (STD), ranges and p- values generated by the MEANS procedure and the GLM procedure.

"th a simple and flexible method for adding data smoothing to their analytical tool box. The user can specify the input data set, the variable to be smoothed, the period of smoothing, and optionally to use center-weighting in the smoothing process. The macro also includes facilities for by-group type processing of stacked groups of data in a single variable. INTRODUCTION Data smoothing intends to draw out the underlying trend from noisy data. The strength of this technique lies in the flexibility allowed in achieving this goal. Data smoothing does not require linear or even quadratic modeling of the data. Instead, the results are based on averaging over a number of nearby points, where the number of points and weighting system for those points is user-definable. As such, data smoothing is flexible not only in fitting the data, but also in its applicability to a wide variety of data. To make the smoothing process as efficient as possible, a single DATA step, requiring only a single pass at the data, contains the smoothing computations. All other steps in the macro perform input and output data handling, or define the macro itself. What follows is a description of that code, which is included at the end of this paper.

"INTRODUCTION CREATING HOT-KEYS FOR DATA ENTRY IN FSEDIT Alexa Parliyan Pfizer Inc., New York, NY While creating an FSEDIT screen for data entry, the users I was working with requested that I give them a hot-key for entering a value that they constantly enter todays date. The techniques shown in this Coders Corner paper provide two ways to designate a single key for entry of often-used values in an FSEDIT screen. This paper provides specific information for entering dates, however, these techniques may be modified and used for other values as well. THE EXAMPLE The FSEDIT screen I was creating required users to enter dates in a log-style screen. As each step in the process was completed, the user would enter the date: Study: ABC123 Date in: OIJUL96 Date reviewed: 02JUL96 Date finalized: 03JUL96 Since the dates were stored as SAS date values with the numeric informats of ddmmyy, the users were required to enter six-digit numbers for each date. If todays date was July 1, 1996, and several studies were to be logged, the user would need to go to each study observation and type 01 0796 in the desired field. Instead, what they wanted was to type simply the letter t, or the function key FI, which would set the desired field to todays date. A SPECIAL CASE: SAS DATE VALUES Typically, if a value to be entered was in a constant range, the conversion could be hard-coded. For example, if a user had a choice of entering 1 for red, 2 for white and 3 for blue, the code could directly map the input values with the output via formatting or using computation variables on the FSEDIT screen. However, the date values I used had numeric informats. If1 was entered for a date field with an informat, it would not match the informat, and the field would not be updated. If there was no informat, SAS would require the actual SAS date value. Hence, an entry of1 would yield 02JAN60.

Suppose the data set TXADMIN contains TX data and the data set MKELIG contains ELIG data, they are: . . . .  ------- Data Set TXADMIN -------- PATID TX .         101 1 102 1 103 2 ------- Data Set MKELIG -------- PATID EUG  101 Eligible 102 Ineligible 103 Violator The following statements create control data sets TXCN~ and ELIGCNT: .- . ,.. data TXCNT; retain fmtname TX type N; set TXADMIN; start= patid; select; when tx= 1 then label= Experimental; when tx=2 then label= Control; otherwise label= ; end; run; data ELIGCNT; retain fmtname ELIG type N; set MKELIG(rename=(patid= start elig=label)); run; Once the control data sets create, the TX and ELIG formats can be built by using FORMAT procedure with CNTLIN option as follows: libname library SAS- data -lib i-ary; proc format library =library.formats2 cntlin=TXCNT; ( or cntlin=ELIGCNT); run; SPECIFYING ANOTHER PERMANENT FORMAT CATALOG If you specify LIBRARY=LIBRARY in the PROC FORMAT statement, all associated formats and informats with a study raw data normally are stored in the permanent catalog LIBRARY.

"ROC TRANSPOSE procedure maybe flexible enough to generate a variety of report formats, it may not be appropriate if the user requests a custom report. In addition, for some cases, it may not be possible to successfully apply the Transpose procedore to obtain the desired output. A technique is presented that will provide the user with more control on the number and order of the columns generated, enable new columns to be created, and allow for transposing of several variables horn different data files. The features of the two methods are compared and discussed. INTRODUCTION Often, there is a need to rearrange data to fit a specific format for presentation or statistical analysis. This involves rotating the axis of information from one dimension to another. Mechanically, this means the turning of all columns into rows or rows into columns. This results in observations being new variables. In the final output, information is usually summarized by a given set of variables over another set of variables. The need for custom report generation ofien requires an alternative method to the Transpose procedure to obtain the desired output. This can be achieved through a series of PROC SUMMARY and DATA STEPS. The features of the two methods are compared and discussed.

"presented here that will assist users in performing power transformations to non-normally distributed variables. The code estimates a range of values of , selects the appropriate value, and assesses the normality of the transformed variable. The macrocode has been tested using SAS ® software, release 6.09 for Unix platforms, and SAS 6.11 for Windows 95, but should work with other SAS releases, as well. Power Transformations When dealing with parametric statistics, one of the assumptions that must hold true is that the examined variables are normally distributed (Kirk, 1982). SAS users can use the SAS/BASE ® UNIVARIATE procedure, with the optional statements NORMAL and PLOT, to test for normality and obtain stem-andleaf and box-and-whisker plots of the variables' distributions. Other available options inlude the SAS/QC ® CAPABILITY procedure with the QQPLOT statement for quantile-quantile plots (qq-plots) of the examined variables or SAS/INSIGHT ® to obtain similar descriptive statistics and graphs of high resolution. If the variables under examination are not normally distributed, several transformations are suggested based on the nature of the data. Counts can be transformed to near normality by taking their square roots. Correlation coefficients are transformed to Fisher's Zs. However, when the choice of transformation is not obvious, power transformations may be suitable for the job (Johnson & Wichern, 1993).

"of graphic components such as annotations and legends can be a time consuming process, since many iterations may be required before the final result is satisfactory.   The size and location of graphics elements may change when a graph designed for one device is printed on another. This paper will show how to create a printer dependent template (grid overlay) and how to use it as a guide to create and modify graphs. INTRODUCTION Creating a graph using SAS/GRAPH software is a simple task, but customizing the graph for different printers or device drivers is not that easy. If the specifications of the new and old printers or device drivers are not the same, then graphics output area is also not the same. As a result, the origin of the graph may shift away from its original position, including changes in the size of graphic components(such as pie slices, bar width etc.) The final graph may distort slightly or in some cases dramatically. If one needs to create a new customized SAS/GRAPH or wants to keep the existing texture of the old graph but needs to use new device driver or printer, a grid overlay will cut down the time and effort. ANALYSIS Graphics Output Area One of the way to recreate the graph on the new device is to use the same HSIZE=, VSIZE=, PCOLS=, PROWS=, HORIGIN= and VORIGIN= options in the GOPTIONS statements, but this approach does not utilize the features of the new printer or device driver. For example, if the new printer can use a larger HSIZE and VSIZE values,",PAPER97.pdf
"Writing programs to run SAS/GRAPH software has long been a challenging task for many programmers. Understanding how to display, store and print the output are all difficult issues which must be faced even after appropriate SASIGRAPH syntax has been developed. By using standard GOPTIONSi, the GOUT option to store graphs in catalogs, and PROC GREPLAY to name the graphical entries in the catalog, a simplified method for organizing your SAS graphs is achieved. This method allows for both on-screen displays and printouts of your graph. Additionally, once stored in a SAS catalog, future access of your graph is possible without the need to re- submit the program which originally created the graph.",PAPER98.pdf
"In an international epidemiological study of 2000 cardiac surgery patients, the data of 7000 variables are entered through a Visual Basic ® data entry system and stored in 57 large ORACLE ® tables. A SAS ® application is developed to convert the ORACLE tables to SAS tables, perform intensive data processing in SAS, and based upon the result of the data processing, dynamically pass ORACLE SQL Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands such as UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT to ORACLE database and modify the data in the 57 ORACLE tables. The objective is to achieve speed and efficiency in dealing with the large ORACLE database using SAS software. This paper addresses how such a SAS application is designed and implemented. It automatically converts data from ORACLE to SAS including appropriate labels and formats. The data converted are then processed in such a way that only necessary data transactions will later be passed dynamically to ORACLE. In addition, SQL procedure pass-through facility provided by SAS/ACCESS ® is used to manipulate the data in ORACLE, because it avoids unnecessary sorting in ORACLE data and thus works in an efficient fashion. 1.0",p1.pdf

"A successful data warehouse is not solely dependent on surfacing data organized for decision support activities or controlling the processes by which the data warehouse is built. In fact, the success of the data warehouse is dependent on the ability of the end-user community to understand and gain access to the newly created information. The decision support user must be comfortable with the information that they are basing their decisions on. The user, whether based in IT or the decision support departments, must be able to have answers to the following questions readily available: How do we gain access to the decision support data? Where does it reside in our enterprise? How and where was the data derived? When was the data loaded and when is it scheduled to be refreshed? What does all this information mean? By using the SAS/Warehouse Administrator to define and build the data warehouse, the enterprise gains a new and significant asset  a central metadata store.

"Developing a Data Warehouse can be very costly to any enterprise in terms of both resources and money. There is a certain amount of fixed cost in every data warehousing project, with an additional set of variable costs depending upon the scope of project. The spending of the fixed cost requires a leap of faith based on the assumption that the potential benefits of developing the Data Warehouse will be accrued. The variable costs can be more closely monitored, with additional resources only being incrementally used based upon the return (benefits). This paper will discuss the importance of developing a data warehousing process that inherently allows for the measurement of success. Each Data Warehouse will require a different process, based upon the particular needs and culture of the enterprise. The measurement of success will also differ from Data Warehouse implementation to implementation.   The paper will also purport an algorithm that in principle is very simple that can be used to measure the success of a Data Warehouse.",p104.pdf

"1 Building the Framework for Enterprise Data Analysis in the Semiconductor Industry John T. Stokes, JJT Inc., Austin, Texas Roger Thompson, JJT Inc., Dallas Texas Introduction Leading semiconductor companies have always recognized the benefit a common framework for engineering data analysis could bring to the bottom line. Because commercial software solutions were not available, manufacturers developed in-house systems to address their unique data analysis problems. Unfortunately, attempts by many companies to implement an enterprise engineering data analysis system have been met with mixed results. Over time, these applications became a resource burden to maintain, and quickly became obsolete due to the pace at which new technology is adopted in the supporting hardware and software infrastructure. This paper will address the importance of building an integrated infrastructure for enterprise data analysis and selecting a data model that provides the optimal balance of data accessibility, efficiency and maintainability. Need for Data Analysis Companies who wish to remain competitive in the semiconductor industry are driven by aggressive goals to be the first to market with high quality, low cost products. Currently, the semiconductor industry experiences price per unit erosion of 20% or more annually. There is no indication that this trend is going to change in the near term. The market will continue to expect smaller, faster, cheaper electronics. Consequently, in order for a semiconductor manufacturer to remain profitable and competitive, they must be able to reduce cost per component accordingly. Simply cutting staff or capital expenditures on a one-time basis will not effect the kind of repeated annual cost reductions needed. To reduce overall cost and remain profitable, manufacturers must improve yield, increase productivity of both people and equipment, and expedite time to market of new products with leading edge technology. Because of inherent fluctuations in",p109.pdf

It is completely modular, and allows for an environment where multiple programmers may be working on importing the same data. The program runs regardless of which modules are present. Switching from a test environment to the production, and back, requires only a single string change in the driver. You may also produce a mapping of variables to formats across data sets.",p111.pdf
"h the Version 7 release of the SAS ® System, SAS/ACCESS software provides many important enhancements that allow SAS users to transparently integrate their Database Management Systems (DBMS) with their SAS business solutions. New in Version 7, dynamic DBMS engines enable the SAS user to assign a SAS library that dynamically connects to the DBMS data server. SAS programs using the library can then directly list, read, update, delete and create DBMS tables. The creation of static access and view descriptors is no longer required. Dynamic engines are available in the Version 7 SAS/ACCESS interfaces for DB2 ® , ORACLE ® , ODBC, INFORMIX ® , SYBASE ® , and INGRES ® . Additional features and performance improvements include support for table and column names up to 32 characters, support for case-sensitive DBMS object names, passing joins directly to the DBMS server for processing, updating data in a DBMS table via an SQL view of the table, more control over the use of DBMS indexes, locking and concurrency control, and updating descriptors using the ACCESS procedure. The dynamic Data Step Interface, supported by the SAS/ACCESS interfaces to IMS and IDMS, has been enhanced in Version 7 to support the longer SAS names while still maintaining Version 6 compatibility.

Reedy, Eisenhower Army Medical Center, Fort Gordon, GA Rob Lenderman, The Bradford Groupe, Ltd., Raleigh, North Carolina , James Zadinsky, Office of Telemedicine, University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill, NC Vicki Harp, Science Applications International Corporation, Fort Gordon, GA Abstract Health care information is crucial to making decisions that will help to contain the costs of health care. Within the military community, the effort to improve medical care, to meet multilevel management information needs, and to support the readiness initiative is hampered by the storage of Department of Defense (DoD) medical information in large legacy databases in a format that is difficult for physicians and administrators to use for analysis and reporting. The military medical database system is fragmented over multiple physical sites, and includes several legacy systems (Zadinsky, 1997). Portions of a patients medical record may be stored in multiple databases of differing structures at multiple medical treatment facilities (MTFs). Access to the medical information requires the linking of multiple databases, both military and civilian. Due to the heterogenity of the databases, the linking of the databases necessitates the translation of the data and data structures so that the data in the composite database have the same meaning.

The presentation is oriented to solution providers as well as to technical developers who are looking for experience in the domain of unlocking the SAP/R3 system for business solutions purposes. The product we used to extract the data for the data warehouse on top of SAP R/3 is SAS/Access to SAP R/3. Our experience learnt us that this is very effective but that also a special methodology and approach is to be used to tackle with the specific requirements of the SAP R/3 system. On this approach we will focus largely in the paper. A method of working and guidelines will be explained, since turning SAP/R3 data into business information is not only a technical challenge but even more a conceptual challenge. Following this methodology a tool is built to answer to your business needs of getting the right information out of the SAP R/3 systems. This tool used together with the SAS/Access to SAP R/3 module offers a very powerful platform to extract the right data and metadata.

"1 Datawarehouse Administration: An urgent need for Technology to Emerge! by Jan J.M. Roording, Dutch Tax Administration, The Netherlands and Steven F.M.J. van Agt, SAS Institute, The Netherlands INTRODUCTION We live in a dynamic and complex world. We all know that things are going fast and will only further speed up in the future. Our data multiplies itself every other period and we know that there is gold in it, somewhere. While the amount of data in our systems keeps growing every year, every month, every day, even every hour, we have to realize that the gold in the paramount of the systems is increasing but also increasingly unreachable. We cannot just dig the nuggets out. So we are missing some real opportunities. There is an urgent need for technology to emerge here! It seems this technology is r eaching the market, Data Warehousing, data-mining and other buzzwords abound. It is in my view however still not mature enough to enable the real goldmining promise. At the Dutch Tax Administration we realized that we had to do something in this area as we have access to incredible quantities of data of all sorts. It might help us better achieve our goal in society: to execute fiscal law as defined by parliament while being as efficient as possible and maintaining the highest level of manageability in our operation. The Tax Administration today wants to achieve the highest level of compliance amongst all types of tax payers. We do this under the slogan: We cannot aim to please, but we do aim for ease! 100% compliance would be when all taxpayers pay their due taxes by themselves without delay. We think we can achieve this by making clear and fair fiscal laws and regulations on one hand and a transparant and as-easy-as-possible process for declaring and collecting taxes. The rules and regulations are defined by parliament and the government. We cannot really influence this. The definition and support of the processes however are our specialty.

"The current SAS-based reporting system provides us with printed reports and tables with a spatial, physical, and static way and a fixed linear structure. Even though indexes, tables of contents, or cross-references exist superimposed on this linear framework and provide added value, often critically important, they do not change the underlying structure. As a result, there are some disadvantages for the linear structure multimedia in the current SAS-based reporting system. First of all, in order to put all these tables and reports together logically, one must organize them manually. In addition, a particular number which was processed and calculated in a table cell cannot be easily drilled down in a dynamic and interactive manner. The most common way we have for the current reporting system is to use footnotes to provide further or detailed explanation or information. Very often the track for further information might be much more time-consuming and labor intensive.

Its primary use may be as a development tool to help in debugging a long multi-step program, or as a simple report generator when all that is really needed is a quick look at the data, or even a basic low-level finished report. However, if a report generation/information delivery tool with powerful formatting, summarizing and analysis features is called for, then PROC REPORT is the solution. PROC REPORT can provide the standard PROC PRINT functionality, but in addition, can easily perform many of the tasks that you would otherwise have to use the SORT, MEANS, FREQ and TABULATE procedures to accomplish. PROC REPORT is part of the Base SAS product, can run in both an interactive screen-painting mode or a batch mode, and should be the basic tool of choice when there is a need to produce powerful and productive reports from SAS data sets. This paper will present the basics of PROC REPORT (non-interactive mode) through a series of progressively more sophisticated examples of code and output. The main thrust behind PROC REPORT has been its interactive WYSIWYG ability, in which reports are designed online via screen painting manipulation of actual output.

"sas ABSTRACT This hands-on workshop will give a basic introduction to using SAS Application Dispatcher to create World Wide Web pages on demand. Workshop participants will learn how to create an HTML form which will invoke a SAS program on a server via the Application Dispatcher. They will also learn how to construct a SAS program which produces web pages upon request from such an HTML form. No previous knowledge of HTML is required. Overview Consider the following transaction. Jane Doe fires up her Web browser and browses her way to my Web page. Looking at my Web page she finds she can request further information on a variety of topics. She makes a few selections, and clicks on the Submit button. Then SAS on my server wakes up, processes a set of data and sends a bar chart back to her browser showing the information she requested. What did I have to do to make this possible? Two things, essentially: (1) create a Web page that contains a form that references my SAS program and (2) write the SAS program that collaborates with this Web page. This workshop teaches the basics on how to create these two components. Figure 1.  Janes Web browser sends a request to my Web server asking for a copy of my Web page.

"1 Preparing SAS Software Applications for the Year 2000 Sunil Kumar Gupta, Millennium Technologies Institute, Inc. Kirk Paul Lafler, Millennium Technologies Institute, Inc. Charles Edwin Shipp, Millennium Technologies Institute, Inc. Introduction Solving the Year 2000 century date problem will be the largest computing task ever performed in history . . . and the costliest. Recent estimates for fixing the problem range between $300 billion and $600 billion and are rapidly climbing. Due to the enormous amount of software code that needs to be converted and the limited amount of time before the next century, organizations around the world are rushing to become Year 2000 compliant. Programmers code programs differently, so there is no automated solution or ""silver bullet"" to fix the problem. The Year 2000 is not a technological problem, but a business problem with strategic implications that have direct impact on an organization's profitability. Solving it will require a common sense approach that keeps applications working while controlling costs. This paper and presentation will describe the problem, issues and challenges, the SAS environment, what a SAS date is, and SAS System solutions to the Year 2000 problem. Origin of the Problem The Year 2000 problem can be traced to the way many computers and programs handle dates by using dates with two-digit year notation, for example 07/07/97. The twodigit year notation has come about from customary date usage, to save storage space, and to save the number of keystrokes incurred by data entry personnel. The twodigit year affects the way data is manipulated, particularly when performing arithmetic computations, date comparisons, and sorting. For example, the year ""1980"" is generally stored as ""80"" in data files, and ""2000"" is stored as ""00"". If you were to compute the difference between 97 and 80 (1997 and 1980 respectively), the result of this operation is accurately computed as 17. The problem immediately becomes more serio",p127.pdf
"1 An Introduction to SAS/ASSIST Software ® Linda P. Atkinson, Economic Research Service/USDA, Washington, D.C. INTRODUCTION SAS/ASSIST software is a user-friendly front-end to the SAS System. Its push-button menus provide options for many of the tasks you would want to perform. Selections are made and acted upon without the user having to write any SAS code. Programs can be saved that will be run repetitively. The SAS/ASSIST interface can be customized to better suit the needs of the user and the environment of the work to be accomplished. ASSIST is designed to be self-explanatory; however, some hands-on experience can be a helpful training aid for the novice user. SAS/ASSIST can be invoked by typing assist on the command line, by clicking on the appropriate icon on the toolbar, or by selecting Globals and SAS/ASSIST from the pull-down or pop-up menus. The default Primary Menu will appear. DATA MANAGEMENT One of the first things you might want to do in the SAS System is browse or edit a set of data. Click on the DATA MGMT button in ASSIST. A wide range of tasks can be specified from the following menu, including doing SQL queries on the data, importing data from other formats, creating subsets, and so on. Some of the options require specific SAS products to be licensed in order to be enabled, such as SAS/FSP to do full-screen browsing or editing of ® SAS data sets and SAS/ACCESS to access external ® database files. An INDEX button can help you get to a specific task easily if you are unsure as to which path would get you to it, and a HELP button is provided as standard on most ASSIST screens. Click on EDIT/BROWSE, Edit data and Tabular format to view the data as a table where the rows are observations and the columns are variables. Select Active data set: and from the choices that are presented, use SASUSER.ORANGES, which is distributed with SAS/ASSIST. Then click on the RUN button.

"Pushing SAS/AF ® and FRAME Entries in MVS to the Limit: The USEPA's AIRS Graphics System Thomas E. Link, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP, NC M. Arthur Alexander III, SAS Institute, Cary, NC First Of All, What Is AIRS? The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) depends on information -- lots of it -- to carry out its mission to protect and improve the nation's air quality. EPA's main collection of computerized information about air pollution is AIRS, the Aerometric Information Retrieval System. To paraphrase the late Carl Sagan (who probably wished that he had never said it), the AIRS database contains literally billions and billions of values. These myriad numbers and words characterize the state of our air. The values in the AIRS database tell how much pollution is released into the air by industry, commerce, and just plain folks. They tell the ambient concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe, and they tell what administrative and legal actions have been taken to fix pollution problems. AIRS gives the 50 states and many local environmental agencies direct access to all the AIRS data, and direct control of their own data. This means the states do not need to develop their own computer systems for reporting air pollution data to EPA. By analyzing the values in AIRS, EPA and the states can determine the ""health"" of our air, where the problems are, and how well remedial actions are working. All of these are good things. But finding the right values among the billions, and sifting through them to find out what they mean can be daunting. AIRS has a vast array of interactive and batch data reporting capabilities. They range in complexity from easy-to-read, succinct reports of summary data, to unformatted data files containing thousands of characters in every one of its thousands of records. The AIRS database reports are designed to provide the detailed air pollution data that environmental analysts and statisticians need, but the reports can p",p13.pdf
"se SAS ® PROC which combines the functionality of the DATA and PROC Steps into a single procedure. PROC SQL in many cases can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. PROC SQL can be used to retrieve, update, and report on information from SAS data sets or other database products. This workshop will concentrate on SQL's syntax and how to access information from existing SAS data sets. Some of the topics covered include: Write SQL code using various styles of the SELECT statement. Dynamically create new variables on the SELECT statement. Use SQL options to control the appearance of reports. Create multiple reports on a single PROC SQL statement. Create reports containing percentages using PROC SQL. Use CASE/WHEN clauses for conditionally processing the data. Joining data from two data sets (like a MERGE!). Why Learn PROC SQL? PROC SQL can not only retrieve information without having to learn SAS syntax, but it can also oftentimes do this with fewer and shorter statements than traditional SAS code. Additionally, on average it uses fewer resources than conventional DATA and PROC steps. This means PROC SQL is usually a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. Further, the knowledge learned is transferrable. An Example of PROC SQL's Syntax Every PROC SQL must have at least one SELECT statement. The purpose of the SELECT statement is to name the columns that will appear on the report and the order in which they will appear (similar to a VAR statement on P",p130.pdf

"er Specialists David L. DesJardins, U.S. Bureau of the Census, Washington, D.C. ABSTRACT: This paper outlines a framework for a revolution in our data analysis capability. This is because of new powerful computer capabilities married to equally powerful/flexible graphics software packages. To illustrate this new capability, it highlights one of these new graphical techniques for data analysis. A basic factor in this technique is the U.S. Census Bureaus new, easy to learn/understand, point-and-click graphical data analysis capability. This paper also suggests that current techniques for imputing missing or erroneous data values in the Bureaus surveys of Business and Industries can be markedly improved. Proposed is the use of  Leverage Plots -- a technique now over a decade old -- but, because of three key developments in technology/capability at the Bureau today, a very applicable methodology to do this task. BACKGROUND: At the U.S. Bureau of the Census, I am expanding the everyday use of very powerful Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methods by teaching novice-level classes to our Survey An alysts. Three key factors make the introduction of these methods at this time a momentous opportunity:        * New, very powerful graphics software (such as JMP ® and INSIGHT ® from SAS Institute Inc.) now give our Subject Matter Specialists the easy to use (point -and-click) tools required to generate EDA graphs.

This paper describes these enhancements and presents some examples of their use. Note that these features are still under development; syntax and usage are subject to change prior to Version 7 release. INTRODUCTION You can use SAS/GRAPH software in the following ways to produce output on the Web: 1. Using SAS/GRAPH Device Drivers This method creates GIF files and can also be used to generate a HTML page containing the associated GIF files. This approach is particularly useful in batch applications where you want to generate a large number of graphs that can be viewed latered with a Web browser. 2. Using ODS (Output Delivery System) This method takes advantage of the Output Delivery System that will be available in Version 7.  ODS can create HTML files and can be used to combine output from multiple procedures (graphics and non-graphics) using custom layouts. You can use SAS/GRAPH options with ODS to create graphs with the drill-down feature. This feature is designed for use in interactive environments . 3. Using the WEBOUT= Option to Create SAS/GRAPH Output Data Sets This method is for users with extensive HTML knowledge who want to write their own Web pages that include SAS/GRAPH output with drill-down capabilities.

"be very influential in an analysis. Finding a way to concisely display all relevant information in a visually appealing manner can be a challenge. This paper will present a method for placing SAS® software output into a standard word processor document. Introduction In the pharmaceutical industry decisions are based not only on the results of statistical analysis combining all patients into an anonymous group, but also by looking at those patients who experience rare or life-threatening reactions to a new drug. But, new drugs are tested in sick people and a bad reaction may not be related to the drug. Identifying which reactions are related to the drug can be like searching for a needle in a haystack. Looking through less data at a time (smaller haystacks) and making the important data stand out (bigger needles) is essential to that process. A great deal of information is collected about each participant in a clinical trial and all of that information is interrelated.  If a patient experiences a heart attack while on an experimental drug his entire medical profile can be of interest. Medical history, current nonstudy drug therapy, other adverse reactions, recent vital signs and other items are each important in determining the role of the experimental drug in the attack. To make that determination all of this information must be reported in a way convenient for review. A Simple (Flawed) Approach Certainly the simplest method would be to create lists using the PRINT procedure.",p142.pdf

"This paper will address the inter-connection between SAS System and Inter-/intra-net technologies with a macro-based reporting system. This system is a generalized macrobased data reporting system, which can be used to create customized HTML format files for Web browsers and text format files for hard copies. This system was initially built in the PC environment based on a 3M system structure, which can make it easy to build, update, and maintain the whole system. The production of text files follows the regular process of external file creation in the SAS System. The creation of HTML files uses DATA _NULL_ and HyperText Markup Language to produce the HTML 3.2 tag set supported by Netscape or Microsoft Internet Explorer or other Web browsers. Three obvious advantages of using this system can be seen as follows. First of all, this reporting system provides us a tool to extend our information delivery ability with SAS System. In addition this system significantly reduces the time required to produce tables from the SAS data sets for both text and HTML format files.

"1 The Tabulate Procedure: One Step Beyond the Final Chapter Stephen M. Noga, Rho Inc. Jeffery M. Abolafia, UNC-CH, Department Of Biostatistics Introduction PROC TABULATE ® is one of the most powerful and flexible procedures for producing customized reports. In a series of papers, Dan Bruns (1991, 1996, 1997) has demonstrated the power of PROC TABULATE, outlining both the basic and more advanced features of PROC TABULATE. However, when a customized report is needed, PROC TABULATE is often passed over in favor of more time consuming and tedious methods such as PROC REPORT, FILE PRINT, or a series of data steps and PROC PRINT. We feel that this is partly due to the fact that the full potential of PROC TABULATE has not been utilized. This paper demonstrates how PROC TABULATE can be used in conjunction with other basic SAS ® techniques to produce customized reports. Through a series of examples, we will show how many customized reports produced with PROC REPORT or FILE PRINT can be more easily constructed with the TABULATE Procedure. This paper assumes a basic understanding of the TABULATE Procedure. The series of papers by Dan Bruns cited above provide an excellent tutor ial on PROC TABULATE. Sample Data Set The data set used in the examples presented in this paper contains 9,784 observations and the following variables: SEX                Sex (1=male 2=female) TRT           Treatment Group (0=placebo 1=drug) AGE              Age in Years CHOL2            Total Cholesterol (Mg/dl) LDL                 Low Density Cholesterol (Mg/dl) HDL                 High Density Cholesterol (Mg/dl) FUTIME         Follow-up Time MORT             All Cause Mortality (0=no 1=yes) CVDDEATH   Cardiovascular Death (0=no 1=yes) CHDDEATH   Coronary Heart Disease Death(0=no 1=yes) DUMMY         Constant (=1 for every observation) Producing Your Basic Table A Basic premise of this paper is that PROC TABULATE is more efficient for table generation than is the data _null_/put method, and it can b",p149.pdf
"Producing Structured Clinical Trial Reports Using SAS: A Company Solution By Andy Lawton, Helen Dewberry and Michael Pearce, Boehringer Ingelheim UK Ltd INTRODUCTION Our complete solution takes three parts; a macro to include SAS tables into Microsoft Word ® as a Word table, SAS graphics device drivers to create graphs for inclusion into Microsoft Word ® and the appendices and a SAS/AF ® application to meet our documentation needs and to standardise the layout and numbering of the data displays and summaries. In this paper we will be concentrating on this later aspect of report production. Boehringer Ingelheim (BI), like all pharmaceutical companies, are required to produce reports on clinical trials in order to obtain registration for new products. We adopted the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industry Associations (EFPIA) proposal 'Structure and Content of Clinical Study Reports' as the company standard, and we have now introduced the ICH proposal.

"1 HOW NOT TO HATE ANNOTATE Susan J. Kenny, Quintiles, Inc., Research Triangle Park, NC INTRODUCTION For new users, mastering the annotate facility within SAS/GRAPH ® software can be a confusing, if not difficult, task. This goal of this paper is to dispel some of this confusion by presenting a overview of the key features of the annotate facility and detailing some examples that may help reduce the annotate learning curve. ANNOTATE OVERVIEW The most frequently used application of the annotate facility is to enhance SAS/GRAPH output. Generally, this means adding graphic elements to a graph produced from one of the SAS/GRAPH procedures, such as GPLOT or GCHART. Descriptions of the attributes of these graphic elements and instructions on how and where to add them to a graph are stored in an annotate data set .  Each observation in the annotate data set represents a command to either perform an action or draw a graphic element. This data set is referenced from within the graph procedure (PROC) and the commands are invoked. The Annotate Data Set There are three types of variables that are important in the annotate data set. The function variable specifies what graphic element to draw or what action to take. The positioning variables specify the X,Y, and Z coordinates for where to draw the graphic element. The attribute variables specify the descriptions of the graphic elements, such as the color, font, or size. Each of these types of variables will be described briefly below. Function Variables The value of the function variable specifies the what type of graphic elements to draw or what action to take. The most frequently used values for this variables are: BAR, DRAW, FRAME, LABEL, MOVE, PIE, POINT, POLY, POLYCONT, AND SYMBOL. These values are fairly self explanatory for what type of graphic element or action is desired   For example, FUNCTION=LABEL specifies to place text, as defined in the attribute variable, at the location specified by the positioning variables.

The current situation in OWTS. added the necessity of presenting the various subscafes (8 scales) by group (2-t- groups) over time (up to 4-5 vi5its). The widespread adoption of health related qua1ity of life (Qot) surveys to measure patient outcomes in clinical practice as well as research has raised the issue of simple graphical display. Such surveys often have multiple subscales to quantifjt disparate dimensions in the QoL, including emotional, physical, and others, When this is combined with the need to present longitudinal data for multiple groups, concise and accessible summarization of results becomes difficutt. This paper presents a straightforward way to graph subscales by group over time, using one of the most common surveys, the Short Form - 36.  The method allows the all eight SF-36 subscales to be presented on a single sheet of paper, and, as we will show, highlights trends and changes both within and between groups.

"Intranets to deliver private corporate information to internal users. At Statistics Canada the Informatics Branch utilizes Intranet technology to communicate with its clients and provide them with up-to-date information on its services and rates. Until recently, we were executing SAS programs, which generated static Web pages for our clients. Static pages fulfill the purpose of distributing the information, however they dont provide the ability to query the data. With the introduction of SAS/IntrNet and Web publishing tools to our application, our Web pages provide clients with the ability to invoke SAS programs on the server. These programs create customized, dynamic Web pages that are sent back to the clients browser. This paper looks at our fully automated Intranet application. Introduction Intranet functionality is often reduced to the dissemination of static documents and company information. This does not demonstrate the power of an Intranet as a contributor to an organizations overall profitability. Intranets and Web based technologies are presenting unique opportunities today. To capitalize on these, we need to link Intranet applications to enterprise business processes. With the introduction of SAS/IntrNet tools we now have the ability to a ccess and display enterprise data on customized dynamic web pages.

Both the level and the slope of these markers play an important role in characterizing disease progression and in identifying study participants for future research. In addition, changes in markers (or viral load) have been key in establishing the efficacy of  highly active antiretroviral therapies (HAART). This article presents a simple SAS macro to compute the slopes using a longitudinal data set. The code consists of a DATA step, SAS functions, PROC FREQ and/or REG, and macro programming. The macro can be used to compute a slope from a single patient, multiple patients or an entire cohort from an epidemiological study. The macro code allows the investigator to specify the following factors for the computation of the slope: (1) the initial time point, (2) the time interval of interest, and (3) the number of time points.",p169.pdf
"The use of SAS software as an industrial-strength application development environment continues to grow. As the size of application suites grows, the need for infrastructure systems occurs too. This paper describes two such systems that this author has successfully implemented in the past. Running regular overnight batch jobs (such as data warehouse loads) requires some kind of error checking. At many sites this comprises one or more staff reviewing the SAS logs each morning to look for errors and warnings. This approach is, at best, tedious and, realistically, unreliable. This paper presents a solution to the perennial problem by detailing an approach for automatically checking the log and emailing the findings to a selected group of recipients. In all applications, the need to prevent corruption of data is paramount; in data-entry and data-editing systems, data can get corrupted if the application does not prevent two or more users from updating the same data element at the same time. On occasions, the facilities provided by SAS software are not flexible or powerful enough for the application in question. This paper provides a design for a SAS/AF class that serialises and controls access to nominated resources within the application environment. Unlike the facilities provided by base SAS software and SAS/SHARE, the SAS/AF class permits the locking of resources between SAS sessions, i.e. non-volatile locks. Thus, a user can lock a resource (such as a workflow item or a budget plan) for an unlimited period of time, regardless of whether the user is actively editing the data at any particular point in time. 2 Email 2.1",p17.pdf

"Creating tables from SAS output may involve use of some rather detailed WordPerfect code. Once the ground has been broken by producing a few tables, future tables can often be done with only modifications. Titles can be put in large bold print, employ various font styles and be underlined. The body of the table can be enclosed in an array of vertical and horizontal lines. Shading can be used for emphasis in various elements of the array. Superscripts can be used for footnotes. In general, tables can be produced by taking the following steps. First prepare the SAS output by inserting tabs for creating columns and writing it to a text file. Next initiate a WordPerfect session and reset defaults to your specific needs. Then invoke WordPerfect menus to create the table, border, a heading with shading and shading for the arrays diagonal elements. Finally record these actions into a macro. It can be edited to make changes and additions and can be replayed for similar text files.

The macro compares fitting a multiple regression model over low leverage points with a fit over the entire data. This is the Rainbow test for measuring the lack of fit in regression. The Bootstrap is used to estimate the bias and an improved estimate for lack of fit is calculated. The procedure is repeated for several different subsets of low leverage points.

"on, New Jersey ABSTRACT Internet and intranet have quickly become important vehicles for information delivery. The versatile HTMLs hyperlink is one of the reasons behind widespread popularity of web technology. In this paper, authors explain different ways to take advantage of hyperlink to organize SAS outputs. Some techniques can also be applied to organize outputs generated with new Output Delivery System. INTRODUCTION The web, including internet and intranet, is a hypertext information system. The idea behind using hypertext is that instead of reading text in a rigid, linear structure, you can easily skip from one point to another, get more information, go back, jump to other topics, and navigate through the text based on what interests you are at the time. Inherited from its mainframe roots, SAS output has been prepared for traditional fan-folder green paper. It typically uses fixed font and presented in monochrome. With web technology, SAS can reach a large audiences. Furthermore, we can use HTMLs hyperlink to gain better accessibility and derivability.

"a, Villanova University, St. Davids, PA Abstract This paper reviews the newly developed statistical procedure Convex Hull Test (CHT) for categorical data analysis, and provides an algorithm and SAS codes to implement the statistical procedure. Introduction Analysis of ordinal categorical data arises quite frequently in clinical trials and other studies. A typical example in clinical trials is to determine whether one treatment is superior to another based on ordered categorical responses. In this case and many other similar ones, stochastic order is a natural hypothesis. Among all available statistical tests, the newly developed Convex Hull Test (CHT) (Berger (1997)) is unbiased and admissible, and has substantially higher overall power than linear rank tests. It is also the best test for the conditional problems in some cases.   Since CHT is a relatively new method, it is not readily available in the SAS system. This paper fills the gap by presenting a ready-to-use SAS program based only on SAS/BASE software so that users can apply the powerful CHT with ease. The next section provides a brief introduction to the concept of CHT, illustrated using an example. An algorithm and SAS macros will then be presented. The paper ends with a discussion followed by references.

"1 And All With the Push of a Button ! Ray Pass, ASG, Inc. THE INTRODUCTION Picture this. Youve got a ton of data sitting in SAS® data files located on a UNIX box at a different site in a different country, in fact on a different continent, but which can easily be reached via TCP/IP or some other network protocol. Youve also got a set of supplementary control data sitting in a series of Excel worksheets on the network to which your PC is connected. The task is to create a system which will combine the SAS data with the Excel data, throw in a couple of manually-entered overall selection control parameters which will govern the ultimate mix of data, create a series of   Microsoft Word reports from a predesigned format (margins, fonts, etc), archive the reports on the network with appropriately updated report names, and have it all executed from start to finish by a group of professionals who cannot spell SAS and who can barely get Windows 95 going. Where to start? Where to go from there? Where to end? This was the challenge. The answers were all in the SAS System, and were actually not that difficult to come by. The final product does it all, starting from a Windows 95 desktop icon which launches SAS with a start macro. The macro presents a simple data entry screen from which the user chooses some selection criteria. After this is accomplished, the macro brings in the Excel data via SAS/ACCESS® Software for PC File Formats. It then signs the user on to the remote UNIX box via SAS/CONNECT (after first checking to see if the user is already signed on  no sense doing it twice and getting an annoying little message that says, Youre already signed on, dummy!). The Excel data, which by now exist as SAS data sets, are PROC UPLOADed to the remote platform, a ton of SAS processing happens there, and the final report image (PROC PRINTTO) is PROC DOWNLOADed back to the PC environment as a text file.

"Mediation analysis seeks to go beyond the question of equations, using the notation from MacKinnon, Warsi, whether an independent variable causes a change in a and Dwyer (1995). dependent variable. Mediation addresses the question of how that change occurs. When a third variable is thought to be intermediate in the relationship between two variables, it is called a mediator. In order to test the mediated effect for significance, or to create confidence limits for the effect, the standard error of the effect is needed. Estimates of the standard error can fluctuate widely when sample size is small or when the variables are not normally distributed. Bootstrapping is a method that resamples from an original sample to derive a more accurate estimate than is found through traditional methods. This paper describes a SAS program that estimates the mediated effect of a sample, takes bootstrap samples, and calculates the standard error and confidence limits of the mediated effect. The audience should have an understanding of multiple regression analysis. This program was written with base SAS software and operates in a regular PC environment.",p180.pdf
"eeting, PA Abstract Michael Raithel presented at the Twenty Second SUGI Conference a very interesting concept of the horizontally summarizing the large data set in SAS. The concept is innovative and important at the age of data warehousing. Since both authors have been extensively involved in processing large data sets, we feel especially interested in this concept. Combining Raithels horizontal summary algorithm with authors own experiences, this paper examines two other algorithms in SAS to further improve performance of the horizontal summarization. The paper will first review Raithels horizontal summary algorithm. When the SUMMARY procedure fails to perform on a huge data set with many CLASS variables, his horizontal algorithm would work by sorting by and summarizing at one particular combination of the CLASS variables at a time, and doing so as many times as necessary to reach out all possible combinations of the CLASS variables. While we greatly appreciate for Raithels concept, we do believe that his algorithm can be changed for better. Our first SAS algorithm is the revision of Raithels. The revised SAS codes will be displayed and explained. Our specific experiment demonstrated 31% to 48% reduction in CPU time by using the revised algorithm. Next, we discuss our second SAS algorithm, which we have created from our experience in processing large data sets over years.

"1 Macros & Matrices: Using the IML Procedure to Access Tabular Information Jamie Perrett, Educators Mutual, Murray, UT INTRODUCTION Sometimes it is necessary to use data in worksheet form and access this data one cell at a time. For example, when calculating insurance rates, you may use pre-determined rates on a rate sheet rather than formulas. It is then necessary to have some type of process that will use given information (i.e. Age, Sex, Smoker/Non-Smoker, etc.) and look up a table value needed to calculate the rate. One way to organize this information is the combined use of macros and matrices through base SAS and SAS/IML ® . RATING EXAMPLE With a table or rate sheet in the following format (Figure1), five variables of interest are needed to determine the appropriate table rate: sex, smoker/non-smoker, policy size, issue age and policy year. There could easily be more variables depending on the complexity of the rating system. Figure 1 POSSIBLE CONCERNS When accessing tabular data, several concerns must be addressed. Here are four. 1.Speed Depending on the computers capabilities and your companys time tables, a programs speed in looking up values can be very important. 2. Disk Space Also depending on the computers capabilities and company needs, the disk space allotted to a task may or may not be limited. 3. Code Efficiency Sloppy, long code can mean headaches to the programmer who has to decipher it for future adjustments. It can also mean unnecessary steps for SAS during run time. 4. Software Constraints SAS/IML is not a part of base SAS and is sometimes not available to the programmer. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS Several solutions exist for these problems. Here are two feasible solutions that warrant consideration for their versatility. You may know another way of handling this problem that better suits your specific situation. A. SQL Procedure One way to access the table rates in Figure 1 is to put the rates into one or more data sets with data set name(s) and a",p185.pdf
"Constantly changing business needs require flexible, easily modifiable Decision Support Systems (DSS). An added level of complexity is introduced by changes to the underlying data location, structure, meaning, or scale. Object Oriented design techniques provide us with a mechanism for crafting DSS which are scalable as well as easily modified. Utilizing specific design patterns, we can provide a system that will work with changing data structures and meanings, and the growth of business logic. This paper presents an Object Oriented design approach to the development of a Decision Support System. It presents solutions to the problems of providing flexibility, usability, and maintainability in one package. The techniques explored are of general interest to anyone involved in application development. Extensive knowledge of SAS/AF, other SAS products involved, or Object Oriented design is not required to derive benefit from the theories presented here.",p186.pdf

"Each month the Credit Policy Department of Commercial Credit produces about 25 different reports to send to the 202 district, 48 region, and 8 division managers. These reports are produced using base SAS ® software in programs run in a production environment under MVS. Each district manager receives portions of the reports specific for that district. Similarly, region and division managers receive portions specific for the districts within regions and for regions within division. Due to the size of these reports and number of recipients, it would take two days for a person to sort and label them for distribution. There was a need for an automatic method to print reports in order by district so that they would not have to be sorted manually. The purpose of this poster is to show how to create SAS data sets and report modules and to use them in conjunction with the SAS macro language to produce reports sorted in district order prior to printing.",p188.pdf
"Checking data is a tedious but necessary stage before data analysis. This paper describes a utility that takes some of the drudgery out of the data checking process and enables one to be more confident about the quality of the data. You often have formats that label valid data values and are permanently associated to variables in a data set. This utility takes advantage of these formats to validate the data. I use the DATASETS procedure to drive the validation process. It provides a list of variables and their formats. Modified formats validate the data. Macros, the SQL procedure and the DATA step provide the tools to link the process. You supply the name of the data set you wish to check and optionally any identifying variable. Then the utility does the rest, listing observations with invalid values for those variables with an associated format. This utility has been tested and run on SAS ® software version 6.11 and 6.12. It should run on all operating systems. The intended audience is for SAS users of moderate or greater experience.",p189.pdf
"1 DATA Step in Version 7:  Whats New? William F. Heffner, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC INTRODUCTION This paper describes some enhancements in the DATA step and its associated environment in Version 7. These enhancements include new rules for names, longer character variables, new functionality for the FILE and INFILE statements, new SAS® file I/O features, new extensions to the DATA step language (including new functions), and some performance improvements. NAME SPACE AND VARIABLE ATTRIBUTE ENHANCEMENTS Names The most visible (and most requested) change in Version 7 involves SAS names. By default, the maximum length for many SAS names has been increased to 32 (from 8 in previous versions). Specific to the DATA step, variable names (including array names), window names, and statement labels may now consist of up to 32 characters. The rules for forming these names (except for the length) have not changed from Version 6. The first character must be a letter (A, B, C, , Z) or an underscore (_), and subsequent characters can be letters, digits (0, 1, , 9), or underscores. Version 7 supports mixed (upper and lower) case names by default. The SAS System will store these names exactly as first given, without uppercasing. This differs from previous versions where names were always normalized (uppercased). Note, however, that even though Version 7 will store these names in mixed case, they will be processed in a case insensitive manner (i.e., as if they were normalized, or uppercased). Names whose spellings differ only in the case of the characters are considered to be the same name. The following names would all reference the same variable. A_DOG_CHASES_A_CAT A_Dog_Chases_A_Cat a_dog_chases_a_cat The SAS System will validate these SAS names based upon the value of the new option VALIDVARNAME=. There are four valid values (V7, UPCASE, V6, ANY) for this option to specify applicable name validation rules. The default setting is VALIDVARNAME=V7, and gives the behavior descr",p19.pdf
"Paper: 190 Proc Tabulate ® :  A Tool for Evaluating Performance Lisa P. Wayte University of Central Florida Introduction In a University environment, the College Administrators need to know how well their faculty or staff member is teaching their students. One way to determine this is to create a survey, usually on scantron. Next, the students evaluate the course after several weeks in attendance. Then the information scanned in and analyzed. This type of tool can give Administrators information such as: Are the course materials useful; How can we improve the content of a class; And how well does this class prepare the student for real world applications. The analysis tool that is used is Proc Tabulate ® .  Proc Tabulate ® performs a summary in a table format of the students' choices for the class and instructor. This information is summarized for a particular class, a department, and a college of the University. Input Data The data for the analysis is read in by a NCS scantron scanner using a NCS scantron survey forms. The student chooses their response for each question by filling in the appropriate circle in each category. After the surveys are collected by each department, they are given to the Test Scoring Center for processing. See Appendix A for a sample survey form. After the surveys are scanned in, an ASCII file is produced. The data is specifically formatted in this manner, a header record followed by the student responses for each question. Since the file contains a lot of classes, there is one header record separating each class. All classes for a particular department are in this file. See Appendix B for sample data file. Processing the Data The ASCII data file produced by the NCS scantron is read in by a SAS ® data step producing two data sets. One data set contains the header record and the other data set contains the student responses. (If a student response is invalid, it is set to missing.) Now, the two data sets are sorted by class and then combin",p190.pdf
"nction, %EVAL() function, performs integer arithmetic only. Calculations on fractions or decimal numeric are definitely not allowed. This paper introduces a macro that has managed to avoid the restriction and creates numeric formats that have adjustable ranges of decimal numbers. The numeric formats are user-defined. The range specifications (including numeric ceiling and floor) can be handled or adjusted by manipulating the concerning macro parameters. The paper shows definitely how powerful and flexible SAS Macro language really is. The SAS products concerned in this paper are mostly SAS/Base and/or Macro. With respect to operating systems, there is not supposed to have any limit to the feasibility of the macro as long as SAS Macro facility is available. The intended audience should hopefully have some experience in programming in SAS/Base (including Macro Language). The skill level of the users is preferably intermediate. The rationale presented on the paper can be extended to some operations other than SAS formats in case calculations on fractions in SAS Macro processing are confronted with. THE IDEA AND OPERATION SAS has documented a sample program of SAS Macro that can set up a series of individual numbers for PROC PLOT operation. Those numbers look like 1.0, 1.1,,1.8, 1.9, etc. However, that program has to be further elaborated before range specifications can possibly be handled.

"os Angeles Abstract This paper illustrates how the SAS System may be used to analyze a major sporting event, the 1997 Masters golf tournament. PROC PLOT, PROC CORR, PROC REG, PROC STEPWISE and PROC RSQUARE are used to develop an econometric model which points out the factors affecting the golfers score. This paper may be of interest to golfers and those familiar with elementary regression analysis. The procedures were run using SAS for Windows version 6.12. Introduction In April of each year the Augusta National Golf Club hosts the premiere golfing event of the year, the Masters Tournament. What singled out the 1997 tournament was the inclusion of a dynamic new 21 year old professional named Tiger Woods - who many watchers of the game would say is the best new member of the Professional Golfers Association to come along in a generation. In addition to being an excellent putter and having a fine short-game, what many golf fans enjoyed seeing was the tremendous length which Tiger Woods hit his tee shots. Since the Augusta course is known for favoring a golfer who can hit the tee shot a long way, the golfing community was very interested in how well Tiger would perform in his first Masters as a professional. Theoretical Model A general knowledge of the game of golf would indicate that there are several measurable factors which account for a players performance: the length and accuracy with which he hits his tee shots, the accuracy of his iron shots and finally, how well he put",p195.pdf
"s the limitations and drawbacks of some traditional approaches used when developing applications, specifically applications that automate tasks and generate output in text or graphical form. An alternative approach is laid out that utilizes object oriented principles to transcend these limitations. Also, this paper will discuss some additional functionality gained from using these techniques. Introduction One common type of application is the automation of some task or series of tasks, generating text or graphical output in a catalog or external file, or a data set. Usually the user wants the ability to change various parameters so that the task will perform differently based on the information they provide. Once the task is defined, the user may want to run the same task periodically. The traditional approach to this problem would be some type of code generation. In SAS you could use macro and/or SCL to generate the code to a file and have the user run that program as needed. This approach has some built-in limitations and drawbacks. Once the task has been run and the output generated, some systems stop, while others provide the capability to view or print the output. The problems that arise here center around handling output in its different formats. The focus of this paper is not on the graphical user interface portion of the process. Rather, this paper deals with the development of the code that lies behind the interface. More specifically the code used to perform the req",p196.pdf
"At various times, most researchers are faced with the need to screen for outliers. Many statistical programs will do this with more or less ease. SAS has two PROCs which will calculate several outlier statistics. They can produce a report and output data set which require further manipulation to use. This data manipulation opens the door of opportunity for program errors which might be difficult to detect. The more statisticians can rely on known code, the more comfortable they can be with the outcome.   CHEKOUT uses several macros to write the value detected as an outlier and its associated RSTUDENT statistic in the output data set from PROC GLM to a text file, OUTLIER.SAS. Also written to this file is the default option to convert the value to missing, and the file is printed as an outlier screening report. OUTLIER.SAS is easily reviewed with a text editor or in SAS , modified if necessary, and used with an %INCLUDE statement in a subsequent DATA step to remove or convert the outliers in an analysis program. Users of CHEKOUT should have knowledge of multivariable statistics and some experience with SAS macro language .",p197.pdf

"demiology Cleveland Clinic Foundation Cleveland, OH ABSTRACT McNemars test is often used to compare two proportions estimated from paired observations. Obuchowski (Statistics in Medicine, in press) has proposed a method extending this to the case where the observations are sampled in clusters. This method is simple to implement and makes no assumptions about the correlation structure. A SAS macro implementing Obuchowskis method is presented. INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE McNemars test 1 is often used to test the null hypothesis that p 1 =p 2, where two proportions are estimated from paired observations (and are therefore correlated). Obuchowski (Statistics in Medicine, in press) has proposed a method extending this to the case where the observations are sampled in clusters. This method is a direct extension of the work of Rao and Scott 2 who compared independent groups of clustered binary data. Like Rao and Scotts method, Obuchowskis method makes no assumptions about the correlation structure. This work was motivated by a study in diagnostic radiology where two tests, PET and SPECT, were compared for the detection of hyperparathyroidism. Seventy-two glands in 21 patients were evaluated by both tests. Following the tests, all patients underwent surgery to determine definitively whether or not hyperparathyroidism was present. The objective of the study was to compare the sensitivity and specificity of the two tests. To do this, one must account for not only the correlation betw",p204.pdf

"Abstract     This paper describes a method of retrieving data from a DB2 BLOB (Binary Large Object) data warehouse using SAS as the data analysis tool. Our current Data Warehouse architecture involves storing summary data in traditional DB2 relational databases and storing raw chip data in a DB2 BLOB data type. With this BLOB data type many opportunities have opened up for our team to experiment with various methods of retrieving data. This paper details the choices we made and the technical reasons why. Background IBM's semiconductor production facility in Essex Junction, Vermont, has a large engineering community and three manufacturing fabricators. With the increase in speed, density, and sophistication of semiconductors the business of manufacturing integrated circuits has become a very competitive business. Improvements in yield, cycle time, and reliability are crucial to maintaining a competitive edge. Integrated data collection, storage, and analysis are the key tools needed to improve ones position in this competitive market world. A correctly modeled Data Warehouse is an integral part of this analysis solution. Semiconductor data collection happens through many different methods, but the storage must be standardized for a warehouse to function. Data types can be classified into three major types : 1) Raw Chip Data 2) Wafer Summary Data 3) Lot Summary Data where a wafer is a collection of chips on a flat circular slice of silicon and a lot is a collection of wafers that flow together through the process line. Wafer and Lot Summary data can easily be stored in traditional DB2 tables because they are orthogonal, but Raw Chip Data has many forms. Determining the best architecture for these databases and the tool to analyze this data was the task at hand. The Challenge Our challenge was to build a RISC based Data Warehouse with a friendly user interface for analysis.

These data sets contain the health care information for over a half a million individuals and can be quite large. In order to prevent the data sets from becoming even larger, simple codes are used to identify the physician or other health service provider, the patients' diagnoses, and the medical procedures undergone. However, in the generation of various reports, more descriptive information is needed about these parameters. This supplemental information is contained in separate data sets. To make this information available, a format library is created from these data sets which maps the codes to the pertinent information.   In order to maintain consistency, the library is kept in a central location on our network and is accessible to all users. Furthermore, certain repetitive chores that are done by all the programmers are maintained in a central macro library. The construction of such a library takes careful planning but can save an enormous amount of disk space and programmer effort. Errors are also minimized and updating the data is easy when the library information is centralized.",p208.pdf

"1 ODS: The DATA Step Knows William F. Heffner, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC INTRODUCTION The Output Delivery System (ODS) in Version 7 implements and controls the formatting of all SAS procedure output. Although primarily created for procedure output, this new functionality is also available for DATA step programs. This paper will first briefly describe the Output Delivery System, and then discuss in more detail the DATA step interface to this new SAS System component. ODS: OUTPUT DELIVERY SYSTEM The Output Delivery System in Version 7 is a new sub-system which all SAS procedures use to produce output. In previous versions of the SAS System all procedures wrote exclusively to the SAS listing file and to output data sets. In Version 7, all procedures produce ODS output objects  binary objects that are rendered to various output destinations by the ODS sub-system. Conceptual Model In Version 6 of the SAS System, procedures produced output by filling a line buffer and then flushing it to the SAS listing file. This approach does not allow proportional font support, nor does it allow access to data values in the listing without rereading the listing. More importantly, there was also no way to upgrade the system to support new output forms as they became available. Each procedure was wed to its own formatting code. ODS was conceived as a better way for procedures to produce output. In Version 7, procedures produce a binary representation of output called an output object. An output object consists of two component parts: a data object containing the raw data values for the piece of output, and a template describing how the piece of output should look. The output object is added to the system and ODS decides, based on the output destinations set by the user, how to render the output. The most important benefit of this approach is that it removes the formatting responsibility from the procedure. This enables the SAS System to support many flavors of output without modify",p21.pdf
"The debate concerning the federal governments role in the support of the arts had lasted for over 140 years when, on September 29, 1965, President Lyndon Johnson signed the National Foundation on the Arts and the Humanities Act, establishing the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. In the subsequent thirty years the National Endowment for the Arts has awarded over 100,000 grants to arts organizations and artists throughout the nation. The number of state arts agencies has grown from 5 to 56. Local arts agencies now number over 3,800. Nonprofit theatres have grown form 46 to over 425, large orchestras have doubled, opera companies have increased six-fold, and there are ten times as many dance companies now as there were in 1965.

"or Medical Statistics, University of Vienna ABSTRACT Comprehensive tables including non-parametric estimates (e.g. median quantiles, interquartile range) are of major concern in descriptive analyses. PROC UNIVARIATE within the SAS ® System is an excellent tool for computing various parametric and nonparametric estimates resulting in extensive output listings. In addition attractive compehensive overview tables of some of these estimates are very helpful. PROC TABULATE allowes overview tables in various styles but unfortunately does not support non-parametric estimates. In this presentation a SAS macro is suggested combining these two PROCs to produce the desired tables. OBJECTIVES In any study we will usually want to summarize some of the data in a simple way. Sometimes this will be as far as the statistical analysis goes. For categorial data frequency tables or bar diagrams can be used to condense information. Within the SAS System this can be performed applying PROC FREQ , PROC CHART or PROC GCHART. The distribution of ordinal or quantitativ data can be visualized using e.g. box-and-whisker plots. In addition to graphical presentation measures of location and variation (parametric and non-parametric) have to be enclosed. The goal is to produce descriptive tables of the following shape: VARIABLES STATISTICS VARIABLE1 VARIABLE2 ...

"1 Introduction Treatment for childhood Leukemia patients has improved over the last twenty years. Increasingly, in vitro drug sensitivity results seem to provide important insight into inter-individual drug resistance (Klumper et al. 1996; Norgaard et al. 1996). These results appear to offer strong prognostic evidence which, when utilized to modify treatment, may improve outcome. However, the methodology associated with analyzing patients assays is often crude. Linear interpolation (often visual) is used to calculate the concentration of a chemotherapeutic agent which provides a lethal dose to 50% of the cells. Thus, no confidence limits can be obtained about the parameter estimates of choice. Moreover, this method fails to consider:  if the specimens being studied were proliferating or non-proliferating,  more than one distinct response to the agent being tested,  the steepness of the dose response curve, and  the failure of the dose response curve to reach a lower limit of 0 or an upper limit other than 100%. Modeling allows for better use of the assay data in that parameters of interest and their standard errors can be estimated. JMP ®   offers several features that facilitate the modeling process:  The graphical interface allows trials of initial parameter values.  The ability to lock and unlock parameters into fixed values enables convergence when there is difficulty.  The profile option allows better estimates of confidence limits for the parameters. Methods Acute Myelogenic (AML) and T-cell patients were accrued from participating institutions of the Pediatric Oncology Group.   All assays were set up utilizing a 96 well microculture plate with 5 wells used as controls. For each agent, including Daunorubicin (DNR), there were 18 wells in serial dilution. The percentage of viable cells was determined after 72 hours. To fit assay data, T-C-Chous (Chou, 1994; Chou, 1991; Chou and Rideout, 1991; Chou and Talalay, 1987) median effects model for one pop",p212.pdf

"onment) is a time series database product of FAME Software Corporation. This paper will describe two SAS macros. The first, GETFAME, copies time series from a FAME database into a SAS dataset. The second macro, PUTFAME, writes SAS variables into a FAME database. The macros pass user input to a FORTRAN program which utilizes subroutines that access FAME databases. These subroutines are the Host Language Interface (or HLI) routines written by FAME Software Corporation. HLI, which is an application programming interface with FAME, can be called by either FORTRAN or C programs. The FORTRAN program called by PUTFAME reads parameters passed by the SAS macro and writes data into a FAME database. The FORTRAN program called by GETFAME reads the parameters passed by SAS, and retrieves FAME time series. It then passes the FAME series back to SAS. PUTFAME is used when data is read from its source by SAS before it is stored as FAME data. These programs are executed under UNIX on SOLARIS 2. To understand this paper, one must be familiar with SAS macros and also have FAME experience. Knowledge of FORTRAN would be helpful. FAME FAME is a product for storing, analyzing, and publishing time series data. FAME data bases are special files managed and indexed by FAME.

"An equivalence clinical trial typically is conducted to demonstrate that there is no clinically significant difference between a standard and an experimental treatment. The study is designed with the desired outcome being equivalence in efficacy, while immediate toxicity, long-term adverse effects or costs may demonstrate to be advantageous for the experimental treatment. For such experiments the usual hypothesis testing framework, which tests the null hypothesis of no difference in efficacy, is inappropriate. Instead, one tests for the presence a specified difference between the efficacy of the two treatments to be no more than some value delta, . While the theory underlying equivalence trials has been developed and applied in clinical environments (Blackwelder, 1997), dedicated statistical software is lacking.

"Development of new screening tests is ongoing in the medical and biotechnology fields, be it for a medical condition or in an attempt to predict outcome. The screen usually involves a measurement that is then compared to a cutoff point in order to classify the test subject into one of two categories. In developing screening tools, researchers often concentrate on the sensitivity and specificity of the test, and use ROC curves to evaluate the discriminating power of the screening test often ignoring the predictive values of the test. The predictive values of the screen are equally important as they measure the accuracy of the prediction made on a subject whose true condition is unknown. By examining the predictive values, a cutoff point may be chosen such that it minimizes the false positive and false negative rates. A method for obtaining and examining these values using base SAS and SAS/STAT is presented.",p220.pdf
"1 Introduction In the medical field instruments are used for monitoring, diagnosis and screening; that is, they enable measurement, classification, and selection. Non-invasive efficient tools are important. In particular, in this day of cost-effective medicine, cheaper methods are constantly being sought. However, care must be taken that the instrument used does indeed do the job for which it is used, or, if it is less effective, where its possible shortcomings lie. How then should reliability be assessed? Protocols in which two or more measuring instruments are compared are called method comparison studies. In this context, the reliability is defined as how well the two instruments agree. Agreement relates to a range of concepts. One idea they share is the determination of how well measurements made with one instrument may be substituted for measurements made with the other instrument. Often, one method is the gold standard and the results using the new instrument must be nearly identical. Ideally, the measurements from the new instrument will also be less expensive, easier to obtain, and/or quickly available. In fact, if the tool is to be used to detect when a patient is in danger (monitoring), has a certain disease (diagnosis), or should be included in a study (screening), the similarity may only require identical classification. However, even if classification is the aim, how far away a person is from a cutoff value (precision) may be important. Thus, acceptable substitution of one instrument for another depends on both correct patient classification and the size of the error. In this presentation, we will give examples in which substitution of a tool based on a high Pearson correlation coefficient may result in incorrect inclusion and exclusion of patients, as well as false positive and false negative results for efficacy. We will discuss procedures available in SAS that can be reliably used to assess reliability, focusing on method comparison studies. We wil",p221.pdf

In the first example we have added electrocardiologic risk factors to the traditional clinical and demographic risk factors. All analyses were performed on SAS 6.12. The procedure described here mainly concentrates on Cox's regression analysis with risk factors assumed to be constant over time. In the last section a more generalized version of Cox's proportional hazard model is presented. Some possible applications have been presented. 1.0 INTRODUCTION: The paper mainly discusses procedures for the analysis of survival data for patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery (example-1) and heart transplants (example-2). Our analysis included Cox's Multivariate Proportional Hazard Models (SAS PHREG) with stepwise selection process.

"t of Veteran affairs cooperative Studies Program Hines, IL Abstract    Kaplan-Meier(K-M) survival curves can be generated using SAS PROC LIFETEST. In the presence of significant covariates, adjusting the survival curves is necessary. In this paper a step by step method is presented to produce survival curves that adjusted for the covariates. This is accomplished using SAS PROC PHREG and SAS PROC GLPOT. Introduction In clinical research often a comparison of survival curves is made between treatment groups. The SAS PROC LIFETEST produces K-M survival curves that depend only on time. However, the survival curves may depend on both time and covariates. Here, adjusting the survival curves for these covariates is necessary. The problem faced is to devise a method of generating survival curves adjusted for the covariates. To obtain the adjusted survival curves, one must adjust for the covariates that were statistically significant in the regression model. This regression model then estimates the survival function. This paper presents a method to generate survival curves adjusted for the covariates from a Cox proportional hazard model. An example taken from the VA Cooperative Study #90,Prognosis and Outcome Following Heart Valve Replacement, consisting of a total of 938 aortic patients (299 medical patients and 639 surgical patients) was used to illustrate this method.

"This paper discusses a process of developing multiple logistic regression models based on the availability of data, as well as the presentation of corresponding results. The process was developed for an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPD-MA) because the authors team was faced with the problem of creating a standard, uniform model that would push all available covariates through SAS/STAT ® softwares PROC LOGISTIC allowing results to be compared among 17 international studies with similar information. Studies did not necessarily collect the same set of variables nor use identical definitions, and data that were collected sometimes included high percentages of missing values. Since PROC LOGISTIC requires uniform coding and does not accommodate missing data, a program was needed to enhance the process of input to and output from the PROC LOGISTIC procedure. The most important steps in implementing this process are not in running the PROC LOGISTIC model, but in utilizing SAS ® software tools to filter the data in and out of the procedure so that meaningful results may be presented. These steps include the following: Determining the availability of data Selecting variables for the regression model Running PROC LOGISTIC Calculating additional statistics Presenting the data",p227.pdf

"The MIXED procedure, already widely used for fitting mixed effects and repeated measures models, is also a valuable tool for multivariate analysis.

This paper presents a series of examples, with emphasis on points (1) and (2) above, to demonstrate multivariate linear model analysis using MIXED. Topics covered include likelihood ratio tests, Wald tests, and model selection using information criteria and their corresponding R-squares.

"Researchers involved with longitudinal studies are faced with the problem of trying to get study subjects to return for every follow-up visit. There is always some amount of missing data when looking at these types of studies. The MIXED procedure of the SAS ® enables examination of correlational structures and variability changes between repeated measurements on experimental units across time. While PROC MIXED has the capacity to handle unbalanced data when the data are missing at random, a question arises as to when the degree of sparseness jeopardizes inference. Simulation is a tool that can be used to answer these types of questions. This paper show how to simulate sets of data where an assumption of a Toeplitz structure has been made for the variancecovariance (V-C) relationship of the repeated measurements. Then observations are systematically deleted at rates of 10%, 20%, and 25% in specific patterns. Comparisons of the suitability of the Toeplitz versus the unstructured or compound symmetric models were made using Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRTs). Sample sizes can be increased in the simulations until the underlying covariance structure is determined 95% of the time (the p-value for the LRT is set at 0.05).",p231.pdf

"Statistical Process Monitoring (SPM) is used quite extensively in semiconductor manufacturing, particularly in the areas of yield enhancement and contamination (particles) reduction. These variables are typically measured at the Integrated Circuit (IC)-level, and then summarized to the wafer and lot levels. Due to the batch nature of semiconductor processing, ICs residing in the same wafer are normally processed simultaneously. This tends to induce a positive correlation among the measurements taken at the IC level. It is known that within subgroup correlation affects the performance of control charts. In particular, it tends to induce higher than expected false alarm rates. In this paper we present 3-sigma Shewhart charts, for both yield and particle data, and CUSUM monitoring charts for yield data. These charts use mixture distributions to take into account the inherent correlation in the data; thus reducing the false alarm rate. A SAS/AF ® application has been developed to deploy the use of our SPM schemes. The application allows the engineers and analysts to seamlessly: (1) estimate the parameters of these mixture distributions (betabinomial for yield data and negative binomial for particle data) using SAS/IML ® optimization routines, and (2) produce the corresponding customized control charts using SAS/GPLOT ® and SAS/SHEWHART ® .

"ract: Over a period of several years, we have developed an application to handle our data entry/editing, reporting and verification as well as a variety of other data processing functions. This application was written for and ran on a Digital VAX ® under the VMS ® operating system. As the demands on the VAX grew, performance degraded. We therefore decided to investigate the possibility of converting to WINDOWS NT ® operating system and a PC server. We also recognized other benefits including an appearance similar to other user applications; a more user friendly interface allowing use of the mouse; and the ability to share information with other PC-based applications. We wished to consider several configurations (directory locations, remote processing) to be able to determine the best system for our application and environment.

"BEHIND MARKETING DATA IN FINANCIAL INDUSTRY Behavioural Analysis of Retail Customers: A Case Study from Banca Commerciale Italiana Flavio Addolorato - Luca Bodio - Luigi Ferrari - Luigi Guastalla Banca Commerciale Italiana Abstract: the objective of this work is to test the use of several analytical instruments (data mining tools) in order to pinpoint some of the behavioural characteristics of the banks retail clientele . DEFINITION OF SAMPLE The sample was constructed in accordance with two stratification variables: the combinations of products held by retail customers (Current Accounts, Savings Passbooks / Certificates of Deposit, Loans and Investments), and their distribution over five geographic areas. The data were sourced from the corresponding product files. We then reclassified the data on the basis of a client-physical person logic, with the use of the General Customer Number (GCN) assigned to each customer; i.e. the client is the logical unit of every analysis. In the case of joint account relationships, we opted to duplicate the products utilized for each of the individual GCNs involved, treating each GCN as an individual customer. The following files were considered: Customer information (103,267 GCN) Current account statistics ( 40,427) Passbook savings statistics ( 32,931) Credit card statistics ( 30,290) Securities statistics ( 51,551) Loan statistics ( 30,672) Insurance statistics (  3,816) Certificate of deposit statistics ( 33,736) The extraction of data was made with reference to 31 December 1995. The data in each file were relative to the July-December 1995 period, and were considered as both stock and flow information. We attempted to cover the entire analytical process - from the extraction of the data to the identification of the selling tools - in order to highlight the potential of the statistical tools and any related implementation problems.

This is an approaches which sort the data by classing variables and use issue for us in the ACS, since our item non-response rates data steps with RETAIN statements to impute for each vary between 1-20% depending on the question, and therefore variable, one at a time.

"Researchers use sample surveys to obtain information on a wide variety of issues. Many surveys are based on probability-based complex sample designs, including stratified selection, clustering, and unequal weighting. To make statistically valid inferences from the sample to the study population, researchers must analyze the data taking into account the sample design. In Version 7 of the SAS System, These new procedures are being added for the analysis of data from complex sample surveys. These procedures use input describing the sample design to produce the appropriate statistical analyses. The SURVEYSELECT procedure selects probability samples using various sample designs, including stratified sampling and sampling with probability proportional to size. The SURVEYMEANS procedure computes descriptive statistics for sample survey data, including means, totals, and their standard errors.

"1 Graphical Presentation of a Nonparametric Regression with Bootstrapped Confidence Intervals Mark Nicolich & Gail Jorgensen Exxon Biomedical Science, Inc., East Millstone, NJ INTRODUCTION Parametric regression (least-squares) techniques are used to estimate a statistical model that attempts to predict a variable based on one, or more, other variables. The model is required to have a specified algebraic form such as a straight line, a parabola, or an exponential curve. An example would be predicting a persons annual income based on their age, years of schooling and gender using a linear model of the form:    income = A + B*age + C*years_of_school + D*gender These models are restrictive because it is not always possible to find a simple mathematical model form to describe the relationship that exists between the variables. An alternative approach is to use nonparametric models which do not require exact specification of the model form. The approach is known under several names such as nonparametric regression and smoothing. Both the parametric and nonparametric methods have their advantages and disadvantages. The parametric approach has the problem of inexact results if the model is not correctly specified, while the nonparametric approach has the problem of not making full use of the data when the model is known exactly. The appropriate method to use depends on the data at hand and the questions to be answered by the data. NONPARAMETRIC REGRESSION There are several nonparametric methods (Härdle, 1989) which can be used to form the regression line. The methods include kernel smoothing, spline fitting or smoothing, L-Smoothing, R-smoothing, Msmoothing, and LOWESS techniques. The techniques are mathematically related to each other, but have different properties which are advantageous in different situations. The technique discussed in this paper is a useful method proposed by Cleveland (1979) which has the advantage of not being sensitive to outliers (it is robust) and",p248.pdf
"cedure FREQ provides both an approximate and an exact p-value, as well as an approximate confidence interval for the ratio of the two proportions. Calculation of the difference of two proportions and any confidence interval for this difference, however, must be done in a DATA step. I have written a SAS ® macro to calculate exact confidence intervals for the difference of two proportions based on an algorithm previously only implemented in FORTRAN (Coe and Tamhane 1993). I have also written a SAS ® macro to calculate exact confidence intervals for a single proportion. As well as being more accurate, exact confidence intervals have the added advantage over approximate confidence intervals of being welldefined even if one or both of the observed proportions is close (or equal) to 0 or 1. The algorithm used constructs confidence intervals which are, in general, less over-conservative (and consequently narrower) that those calculated by the commercially available software package StatXact ® .

"Each SAS data set has its corresponding file in the SAS work directory. Creating or reading a SAS data set involves I/O activities in the SAS work directory. As CPU speed has increased dramatically for the past decade and multiple CPUs are available on a system, the I/O throughput of the SAS work directory could easily become a system bottleneck and a key factor in determining SAS performance. Using a HP 9000 UNIX system as an example, this paper first shows how seriously SAS performance can be affected by this I/O bottleneck. Then it discusses using different system configurations and storage hardware to improve SAS performance. It shows that SAS performance can be tripled using a fast storage device for the SAS work directory and a modified system configuration. This method can also be applied to other computer platforms to improve SAS performance. This paper is for those who want to improve their SAS performance, i.e., run their SAS jobs faster.

"nts a high level overview of new database features added to Version 7. Some of the features presented in this overview have been top-vote getters when they appeared on the SASWare Ballot (such as long mixed-case column names and versioning). Some of the new features were added to make the SAS System more of a DBMS (such as integrity constraints). Concatenation SAS libraries and SAS catalogs may be logically combined through library and catalog concatenation. Concatenation provides a tool for establishing a search list for locating the information contained in a SAS library or catalog. Library Concatenation Concatenation allows you to reference two or more SAS libraries with a single libref. In Version 6, some platforms, such as Windows and HP-UX, supported a limited form of library concatenation. The limited support of V6 had several problems:  It allowed only one form of the concatenation syntax -all the levels were specified as quoted physical names.  It was not portable; SAS programs that used concatenation could not be easily moved from one platform to another.  Concatenation was limited to the base engine. In Version 7, all platforms support SAS library concatenation. The libraries to be combined may be specified as librefs or as quoted physical names. The following are valid library concatenations: libname foo ('path1' 'path2' 'path3'); libname foo (A B C); libname foo ('path' A B); libname bar (foo C D); The quoted names in the above examples are physical library na",p256.pdf

SAS is a registered trad emark or trademark of SAS Institute Inc. in the USA and other countries. ® indicates USA registration. Other brand and product names are registered trademarks or Trademarks of their respective companies. Introduction Early adopters of rightsizing strategies in the 1990s began a swing of the pendulum toward distributed systems such as UNIX open systems and Microsoft NT as a viable alternatives to mainframe and large batchprocessing platforms for handling departmental and workgroup analytical processing. The scope of this paper is not to argue the benefits of the mainframe over alternative server technologies. Rather, the focus here is to help decision-makers to understand the factors involved in choosing between NT and UNIX for running SAS applications. Specifically, we will talk about the different ways in which SAS can be used in these environments. Then the discussion will move to the general topic of the hardware configurations that are important in choosing a scalable platform for deploying your application. This paper first addresses some general hardware information and how SAS can be used in both the Microsoft NT and UNIX environments. We do this because there are often misconceptions about how SAS can be installed and utilized in a server environment. Secondly, we talk about the more general factors that can have an impact on how successful one platform can be over the other. Overview of NT and UNIX platforms Microsoft NT and various flavors of UNIX have quickly become the defacto standard for small, mid-size and even large SAS installations. As the price/ performance ratio has made it affordable, yet powerful to run terabyte-size data warehouses in these environments. Early versions of NT were often seen as clumsy and slow but offered simple workgrou",p259.pdf
"t process is one of the surest ways to assure a successful development project. And, a good development environment is one of the most important pieces of a good development process. This is certainly true, for example, developing systems in C++ or in Visual Basic. It is just as important when developing SAS production systems. Without a well designed development environment, large projects can be very difficult to successfully complete, and once in production the system can be hard to maintain. This paper describes the features of well designed development and production environments for base SAS software projects and presents the framework for a generic development environment in SAS which would be appropriate, regardless of the application. 1.0 Introduction: While good practices are always desirable, they are not quite as vital for many routine SAS tasks, such as ad-hoc, or exploratory data analysis. Rather, the importance of this topic emerges in production systems, ones which run repetitively and must be supported over time with upgrades. Characteristics of a good environment for development and production are: 1. the process of testing, tracking changes, and migrating code from development to production is well understood and followed by all project members, 2. code can be developed and modified without adversely affecting existing production runs during the development process, 3. code can be migrated to the production environment without having to be altered in any wa",p26.pdf
"New V7 Client/Server Capabilities to Solve and Secure Your Distributed Processing Needs Cheryl Garner, SAS Institute, Inc. Introduction This paper introduces several new Version 7 SAS/CONNECT® capabilities designed to facilitate and secure distributed processing. The features covered in this paper include: asynchronous rsubmit, cross-environment data access (CEDA), messaging, remote objecting, agent services, and data encryption. Asynchronous rsubmit allows you to initiate a remote submit and immediately regain control in the local SAS® session to continue processing. CEDA enables direct processing of SAS data files across multiple platforms. Messaging capabilities provide both direct and indirect messaging to facilitate the development of multi-tiered distributed applications and applications that can communicate independently of time, logic flow, and location. Remote objecting provides application developers the ability to distribute objects in their applications across hardware platforms. Agent services allow both scheduled and dynamic execution of SAS source code containing built-in conditional logic to run across your network. And, data encryption provides privacy of your data as it is sent across the network. Asynchronous Compute Services Compute services give you easy access to many of the remote resources on your network from a single local SAS session. SAS/CONNECT provides access to remote resources in two forms, synchronous and asynchronous. With synchronous processing, the default behavior, you wait for the results of the remote processing before you are able to continue local processing. With asynchronous processing, you immediately regain control to continue local processing while the remote job executes, and results can be obtained at a later time. The ability to execute remote submits asynchronously allows you to continue processing on your local host while the remote submit processes in the background. Asynchronous processing provides increased time",p260.pdf
"1 Migration of SAS ® Software From VMS ® to Windows ® NT ® : A Real Life Story Paul Gilbert & Steve Light at DataCeutics, Inc., John Scott Grainger at ClinTrials Research Introduction At ClinTrials Research, Inc. clinical data is maintained in Ingress and Oracle data bases and extracted to SAS for reporting and analysis. An Open VMS SAS mainframe-based configuration is used on DEC VAX and AXP machines. In the VMS SAS programming environment data, programs, output, and work libraries are resident on the VAX cluster and processing is performed on the DEC machines. With approximately 30 active programmers, the burden on the VAX system generated by SAS programming is significant. To reduce the processing load on the VAX it was decided to move SAS processing off the mainframe while retaining central storage of programs and data on the VAX cluster. The target environment that was selected for the migration was a network of Intel-based PCs running Windows NT 4.0 over a 100 MB LAN. This paper describes the specific goals of the project to move SAS processing into NT, the selection of a client/server configuration, and the selection and implementation of tools supporting the distributed SAS environment. Goals The primary goals of the project were as follows: 1) Implement a Windows-based SAS programming environment, with desktop processors running SAS locally to maximize processing distribution. 2) Maintain or reduce the cost of licensing the SAS System software. 3) Provide the ability to easily, quickly and cheaply add more computing power to the SAS programming environment. 4) Distribute processing across multiple locations to level the work load.   This was addressed by including additional Pentium Pro dual processor servers dedicated to running SAS programs. 5) Facilitate code and data management through storage of all code and data in shared, centralized directory structures. 6) Allow for a configuration which is scaleable for a small or large work group. 7) To maximize",p261.pdf
Integrating the SAS System efficiently and effectively in a networked environment is a task that the SAS Software consultant is faced with for each new release of the SAS System. There are configuration issues that must be addressed for the fileserver and the client workstations for the integration to work smoothly.

This paper presents a discussion of the state of Windows NT and how the SAS System Version 7 for Windows takes advantage and integrates with the operating system. Data access and Microsoft BackOffice integration, and hardware considerations are also presented. INTRODUCTION Microsoft Windows NT sales grew dramatically in 1997, as many corporations which have been investigating Windows NT have now begun to deploy Windows NT for the client desktop. Microsoft claims that eleven million licenses for Windows NT Workstation have been sold. This is approximately 9% of the client market. The client platform with the most penetration (as of the end of 1997) is Windows 95, which is on 51 million systems (about 66% of client systems). Many of these 11 million deployments were replacing Windows 3.1 and to some extent Windows 95. Given that there are over 100,000 32-bit Windows applications available, the upgrade is safe for many organizations. Several major PC manufacturers (including Compaq, Dell, DEC, HP, IBM, and Micron) are preinstalling Windows NT Workstation on their business PCs, so the growth is likely to continue. Also, Windows NT Server is making major inroads for mission critical file and compute servers. As hardware capabilities continue to increase on high-end NT Servers, more organizations are taking advantage of this platform as well. This is true in many areas, even f",p265.pdf
"lize the full potential of the Version 7 SAS System on your Windows system. SAS System products for the PC provide many client/server architectures that can be used to access, update and analyze the entire spectrum of enterprise data. Aside from the SAS System itself, two other clients for accessing SAS data on Windows systems are covered: the SAS Universal ODBC Driver (tutorial included) and the SAS System Viewer. Introduction By virtue of the SAS Systems Client/Server support, SAS application developers can implement a wide range of data management and analysis configurations. In addition to using the SAS System itself on Windows client systems, users needing lighter-weight data access can also use the SAS System Viewer to view SAS data in tabular form. If the data need to be migrated to another application, the SAS Universal ODBC Driver can provide this access without depending on the base SAS System. MVA ensures that all of the capabilities of the SAS System on larger systems (such as mainframes and UNIX systems) can run on PC hardware as well. The SAS System for Windows, Version 7 Version 7 of the SAS System for Windows improves both its user interface and its interoperability with other PC applications. In addition, it takes better advantage of Windows NT-specific features, and is easier to administer. User interface enhancements continue to provide a more native look and feel expected on the Windows platform. Key GUI enhancements include: print preview, more complete",p266.pdf
"Have you ever come from a SAS ® user group conference with a wish list of products that you wanted and/or needed, only to hear your employer say NO? Too often this occurs, not because the employer is unreasonable, but because of communication problems. The mindsets of managers and software technicians are different; managers are primarily concerned with business goals - programmers and system developers are primarily concerned with code and logic. Thus, the two parties tend to talk past each other and new application development opportunities are lost. This presentation provides SAS users with a ten-step approach toward achieving a solid hit rate on their product wish lists. Using basic management concepts, you will learn how to couch your SAS software requests within a business-compliant framework. A worksheet detailing the ten steps will also be provided.",p269.pdf
"cticut Charles Patridge, The Hartford, Hartford, Connecticut Abstract So are you still printing paper documentation for your SAS applications while everyone else is surfing the web? Well you don't need to know how to brew a JAVA application to publish user manuals that can be read using any common web browser. Further, HTML (Hyper Text Mark-up Language) allows authors to easily incorporate color pictures of application screens, something that can be costly when documentation is delivered via print. Last, HTML allows authors to create manuals that allow readers to jump to the relevant section at the click of a mouse button. This presentation will cover the following topics:  introducing HTML and electronic publishing  contrasting HTML documents with paper publishing  software that makes it easier to create HTML documents  how to capture and convert screens into GIF and JPEG files  design tips for effective HTML documentation  distributing documentation by disk, file servers, and web servers While the presenters cannot guarantee that users will read HTML documentation more carefully than they read the paper version, chances are that using HTML will save money. Further, it will be harder for users to say, ""I don't know where I put the manual.""

Over the years, there has always been a great deal of interest in what SAS skills are needed to assist with gainful employment. We are using this paper, combined with its live presentation, to engage audience discussion about the SAS skill set. The panel will be made up of key individuals who will be able to shed some light as to what is needed in various industries, markets and more. We have asked Herb Kirk, Vice President of Professional Services at SAS Institute, to attend the panel and share viewpoints of what SAS clients are doing with SAS. We will discuss SAS Institute Bootcamp and our internal vetting program for bringing consultants up to speed with the latest SAS technologies. To start the discussion, we decided to do some analysis on the skills we found in our own database of customers. Destiny Corporation has trained thousands of individuals in SAS over the past ten years. We decided to use a sample of this database and students job titles to better understand the skill set that management seems to desire. This database is of U.S. customers coast to coast. The second set of tables breaks out the skill set of several hundred SAS Consultants and Contract Programmers in Europe. SAS product and operating system information is listed within industry. There are some important points to note about information in the following tables:  To understand the skill set, it is important to reference class names with the outline of topics covered in the course.

"A great deal has been said about programming techniques for efficiency and maintainability of SAS programs. We are ® taught to write code that minimizes machine and programmer resources. Unfortunately, easily maintained code requires fewer programmers, and fewer programmers means pink slips and less job security. In these troubled times, programmers need to be able to maximize their indispensability.  Programmers can increase their job security and thereby protect themselves and their families by applying the tips and techniques discussed within this paper. The programmer will be advised when to apply the techniques, and whether the use of the techniques should be subtle or gross. Techniques will cover programming style, editing style, statements to use and avoid, and naming conventions. You will learn to blur data steps, make non-assigning assignment statements, and in general write code that not even you will be able to figure out how or why it works. All the techniques discussed in this paper have been field tested by the authors and other SAS programming professionals.

This paper is intended for development or business managers responsible for providing deliverables, training, and ongoing support to the user community. Business intelligence tools will be identified and defined.   Techniques on how to manage the development process are also provided. INTRODUCTION Outlined in this paper are not only ideas for providing successful, tangible deliverables but suggestions on how to improve the intangible services you are providing as well. These services are just as important as the product itself. You may be able to give the user exactly what they want but they may not like the road they had to travel to get there.   Will they come back to you the next time around? Or, will they find someone else who may take a little longer to meet their needs but is much easier to work with? Think back to the last few times you had a major appliance or automobile repaired. What type of individual or company did you choose? What happens when you have done everything possible yet you have an unreasonable client?

"1 Becoming a SAS ® Master Ginger Carey, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI Helen Carey, Independent Consultant, Kaneohe, HI Introduction The scope of SAS products and their continual enhancement prevents any one person from mastering the entire SAS System. However, we can become masters in the portions of the SAS System that we use. It is not enough to know the building blocks of SASthe statements, syntax, and concepts. We also need to know how to put them together to accomplish our work. In this paper, we guide you to resources available and skills needed in order that you can learn faster and better on your way to mastering SAS and the Information Age. To become a master, you must first believe that you can. Wanting to learn, knowing how to learn and continual learning are important to becoming and being a master. Information Explosion Not having the information you need when you need it leaves you wanting. Not knowing where to look for that information leaves you powerless. In a society where information is king, none of us can afford that. Lois Horowitz Do you doubt that we are living in the Information Age? For many conference attendees, the number one topic at this conference is data warehousing. There is a proliferation of data in the world that needs to be easily and logically stored and retrieved. As an example of the information explosion, think about this. A single days edition of The New York Times contains more information then the average 17th century Englander encountered in an entire lifetime. Five years from today there will be twice as much information in the world as there is today. In the computer field, the doubling time is even shorter. By the year 2000, the doubling will be less than every two years. In our book, SAS Today, A Year of Terrific Tips, we list SAS facts for 1976 and for 1996. Let's look at SAS publications. In 1976 there was one SAS manual, A User's Guide to SAS 76. It consisted of 330 pages and documented the 33 procedures in",p277.pdf

"Pharmaceutical companies do much Base SAS and Macro Language programming in the process of analyzing their clinical trials data. This is one part in their larger process of collecting, managing, analyzing, and presenting this data. Many companies now provide considerable system support for the early part of this process (data collection and management) and for the later part (document publishing and presentation of results). But less has been done to support the analysis part in between; i.e., the process of developing and executing SAS programs for statistical analysis, and then writing and reviewing an analysis document based upon the results of program execution. This ProgramAnalyze-Write-Review process is a major, timeconsuming process in any research organization, and I address automated support for it in this paper.

Major enhancements in Release 6.12 have made VIEWTABLE a very acceptable alternative to PROC FSVIEW for those users with graphics- capable interfaces. Two viewing modes are easily accessed, Table View and Form View. Moving between them is easy, as is customizing the appearance of the columns. The Import Wizard enables creation of SAS tables from dBase, sprea d sh e ets, tab del i m i ted or comma-separated files.

"Because of the increasing popularity of the SAS ® System to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs), many have come to believe that the language used with SAS/AF ® and SAS/FSP ® , called Screen Control Language (SCL), may only be used with visual objects. The truth is that SCL can be used in conjunction with or in place of the SAS macro language to automate SAS batch programs and to better interface them with the computing environment. Specifically, SCL programs may be submitted from within batch programs run on MVS and UNIX host computers. This includes even those host computers on which SAS/AF is not installed!",p33.pdf
"Proper applications are logically divided into functional layers. Classes promote the logical organization of components into generic and application-specific elements. This division allows a  developer to derive generic classes that are reusable in different types of software systems. Classes also enhance usability because they give applications a consistent presentation. For the developer, the advantages of using classes are rapid application development and consistency across multiple applications. The consistency provided by classes contributes to a reduced learning curve for end users as they become familiar with many applications developed with use of the same class libraries. Standard classes handle system-level details like registering users, maintaining a data dictionary, tracking system activity with an error log, typical database management functions, and typical dialogs with the user. Classes also provide default behavior in an application. An application can completely override default behavior for any special application needs, or it can perform tailored behavior and branch to the default behavior. In SAS/AF, classes are organized in SAS® catalogs. An application prototype can be quickly developed in SAS by assembling class entries that are stored in SAS catalog files. This tutorial describes techniques to organize class libraries efficiently as part of an application development framework.",p34.pdf

However, what do you do with all of those SAS applications that already exist in your organization? This Tutorial will address the issues involved in reengineering existing SAS applications for the Web. Whether those applications are batch oriented, use SAS/EIS software, or are SAS/AF  applications using Screen Control Language, certain issues must be considered in the reengineering process. Using several real-world examples, this Tutorial will attempt to illustrate the techniques necessary to successfully Web-enable existing SAS applications.

INTERACTIVE GRAPHICS WITH SAS/AF I used to provide these capabilities using SAS/AF ® . SAS/GRAPH ® vector graphics are made up of individual graphical segments such as lines, points, and text strings. These segments are sequentially numbered, with the first segment drawn being number 1. The SAS/GRAPH Output class provides a _get_info_ method that tells the coordinates of a click upon the screen. The SCL list that is returned also contains an element named SPOTID that corresponds to the SAS/GRAPH graph segment number. One way to identify a click on a graph is by checking the coordinates against the location of elements written to the screen. But a more direct means is to make use of the graph segment number itself. The only issue (which can be substantial) is to figure out which element corresponds to the given graph segment number. Luckily, the segment numbers are not assigned at random, but are assigned in sequence as the elements are written to the screen. So if we know what elements appear on the screen and in what order they were drawn, we can translate a segment number back into a given element. Procedure Graphics For graphs produced by SAS/GRAPH procedures, we do not have access to the internal program code. We can tell by inspection, however, that the procedure may draw the X-axi",p39.pdf
"The Army HEARS Corporate Data Reporting System is a customized enterprise information system operating in a client/server environment, utilizing SAS/AF ® Frame entries for its user interface. The system is designed to provide the Army Hearing Conservation Program managers and consultants with the ability to easily generate a series of standard and customized reports that utilize corporate data collected from all of the Army hearing conservation programs operating worldwide. Standard reports are generated using base SAS software on an MVS mainframe, and then stored on a Windows NT server for quick access locally. Custom report requests can also be submitted locally from within Windows 95 via SAS/CONNECT ® for execution on the MVS mainframe using SAS Macros and DATA steps. When a custom report is completed, it can then be downloaded to the requester's PC for viewing and/or printing via the REPORT procedure. The ability to further analyze and manipulate the generated SAS data sets via SAS/ASSIST ® and Microsoft Excel from within the reporting system greatly enhances the user's capabilities to quickly and efficiently evaluate the effectiveness of the Army Hearing Conservation Program from many different perspectives. This paper describes the development process and obstacles overcome to achieve this customized EIS solution.",p4.pdf

"P96 DEC96 1 Macro = Magic; Where Number of Graphics = Many; Customizing Your Graphics Code with Macros David Mintz, U.S. EPA, Research Triangle Park, NC Nicole G. Mintz, Analytical Sciences, Inc., Durham, NC Abstract Macros can make rerunning SAS ® code almost effortless. Once a macro is set up properly, all the arguments can be changed in a single line of code. This is especially helpful when generating graphics. When applied to graphics code, macros can generate the same graphic multiple times with different titles, axis labels, input data sets, etc. just by changing these attributes in the macro statement. This paper will show you, step by step, how to create a macro for graphics use. Introduction The ability to display information effectively has become an important tool in today's business world. As a result, we SAS programmers often spend hours perfecting code that generates the optimum graphic. Once our code is finished, we put it away. And almost always, we return to that code to generate another graphic of similar nature. If our code has not made use of macros, we have to manually scan the code and change variables that affect titles, axis labels, input data sets, and so on. Not only can this process be time consuming, it also opens the door to human error. The best solution is to convert the code into a SAS macro. The macro can then be called with a single line of code which identifies the macro and the parameter values to be used upon execution. Using a simple exam",p43.pdf

However, those features are useless unless that data is stored in or can be accessed by the SAS System. This presentation will provide an introduction to some of the methods that can be used to pass data into the SAS System, with an emphasis on topics which are associated with PC and server platforms. The attendee will receive an overview of DDE (Dynamic Data Exchange), OLE (Object Linking and Embedding), ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity), and more. This presentation is intended as a companion piece to ""Basic Methods to Introduce External Data Into the SAS System"", which covers fundamental topics such as Base SAS's INFILE and INPUT statements. Together, the two presentations provide a comprehensive overview of the various methods which can be used to pass data into the SAS System.

INTRODUCTION     The little old match-merge is a complicated thing indeed. How complicated? Well in 1997, Foley (see REFERENCES) identified a dozen traps associated with match-merge. Amazingly, that was just the beginning.     This paper identifies and examines another fifteen ways match-merge can ambush a programmer. It summarizes all 28 pitfalls outlined in the two papers and explores defensive strategies to avoid all of them.     Among other strategies, a beta version of a SASÒ macro is presented to catch traps. This macro, when used with the SAS log, will detect or sidestep 88% of the traps. You can use this macro even if you are unfamiliar with macro code.     This article is for anyone who uses the SAS BASE product and match-merge. After studying it, you should know what most of the match-merge pitfalls are and how to defend yourself against them. DECEIVING CODE COMPLEXITY     The first trap to explore is the complexity of the SAS code used for matchmerging. It is deceivingly simple.

"ABSTRACT The SET statement is one of the most frequently used statements in the SAS ® System. It is also probably one of the more misused SAS statements because the SET statement typically works without much programmer input. Proper use of the SET statement is one of the key techniques to improving the efficiency of SAS programs. INTRODUCTION The function of the SET statement is to process existing SAS data sets as input for a DATA step. With no options specified, the SAS System sequentially reads each observation in the named data sets, one observation at a time, until there are no further observations to process. The SET statement is very flexible and has a variety of uses. With some planning by the SAS programmer, proper use of the SET statement and SET statement options can improve the efficiency of most SAS programs. This paper will look at the options for the SET statement and suggest some ways that they can be utilized. SET STATEMENT OVERVIEW The simplest form of the SET statement is SET dsname ; With no options specified, the SAS System sequentially reads each observation in the named data set(s), one observation at a time, until there are no further observations to process. If multiple data sets are listed, all observations in the first data set are read before the SAS Supervisor starts reading the second data set, etc. All variables in the original data set(s) are added to the Program Data Vector of the DATA Step. This process continues until an end of file condition occurs after reading the last observation in the last data set listed in the SET statement. To better understand the operations of the SET statement, there is a brief review of the SAS Supervisor and Program Data Vector concepts on the next page. Up to 50 SAS data sets can be specified in a single SET statement. All the data sets must exist, although they may be empty (contain no observations).   A fatal error will occur and the DATA step will terminate if a data set name that does not exist i",p50.pdf
"STRACT / INTRODUCTION The SAS® System has numerous capabilities to store, analyze, report, and present data. However, those features are useless unless that data is stored in or can be accessed by the SAS System. This presentation will provide an overview into some of the methods that can be used to pass data into the SAS System. It will range from Base SAS's INFILE and INPUT statement to more advanced mechanisms such as SAS/ACCESS®.  It is hoped that there will be some aspects of this presentation for the beginning, the intermediate, and perhaps even the advanced user of the SAS System. It should be noted in advance that the details of this topic can vary from operating system to operating system. This presentation will be primarily aimed at providing an overview which is independent of operating system. The reader is strongly encouraged to use this paper in conjunction with the appropriate manuals and ""Operating System Companions"" to gain a full understanding of the options available to them. SEQUENTIAL FILES The first potential source of data that we shall discuss is the sequential file. There are two steps involved with making any external data known to the SAS System. The source of the data must be defined to SAS, and the data must be subsequently passed to SAS. There are two statements in the DATA step which perform these tasks. The INFILE statement will define the data source, while the INPUT statement will move the data into SAS. The INFILE Statement An external file",p51.pdf

"lting, North Carolina, U.S.A. ABSTRACT This tutorial introduces basic techniques pertinent to moving data files, catalogs, and/or applications between sites or operating environments. Our focus for files is on situations when you need to move data from one database format to another, not simply access files stored in another data management system using a ÒviewerÓ of some sort. To start, we define what we mean by ÒtransferÓ and ÒtranslateÓ in this paper. Basic procedures for transferring files or catalogs are discussed and illustrated with simple examples. The importance of documentation and quality control procedures is stressed. Output (listings, tables) or graphic files are not covered. The primary audience for this presentation includes programmers, data managers, statisticians, and other people responsible for moving data and applications. With a new version of SAS software coming soon, everyone should learn about transfer issues related to upgrading. Only basic knowledge of the SAS system is assumed. No previous experience creating SAS applications is assumed. You should be familiar with the DATA step basics (formats, labels) and data management procedures in Base SAS for manipulating data sets or catalogs. The examples pertain to assorted computer environments. For additional technical details, a list of references is provided as a starting point for learning more.

"W ORKING W ITH SAS ® D ATE AND T IME F UNCTIONS Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. San Francisco, California USA Introduction Many SAS ® applications require that operations be performed on data collected in the time domain. Among these types of operations are:  determining the frequency that a phenomenon of interest occurs in time  determining the a time interval which has elapsed between two phenomena (e.g., length of stay between admission and discharge from the hospital)  conditional operations on observations in a SAS data set based on date and/or time values (e.g., select from a SAS data set only those observations which occurred after a particular point in time).  aggregation of observations from one time frequency to another (e.g., daily to monthly)  interpolation (i.e., estimation) of lower frequency observations from data collected at a higher frequency (e.g., estimating monthly values from data collected quarterly) The SAS System Software provides a wealth of tools for users who need to work with data collected in the time domain. These tools include functions which:  create a SAS date, time or datetime variable from either raw data or from variables in an existing SAS data set  determine the interval between two periods  declare a SAS date or time variable as a constant  extract parts from a SAS date variable, such as the month, day or week, or year A second set of tools, SAS date/time formats, modify the external representation of a SAS date or time variable. As with other SAS System formats, a date, time or datetime format displays the values of the variable according to a specified width and form. Use of date, time or datetime formats is essential when creating applications or programs in the SAS System portraying the values of variables collected in time. Otherwise, the user will most likely not be able to make sense of the values of the variable itself. Over 30 such formats are supported in Version 6 of the SAS System, and",p57.pdf
"Medical School Pippa M. Simpson, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Abstract Many methods have been used for the analysis of repeated measures data. The classical approach is to treat the experimental units in a repeated measures study as blocks in a blocked design. Multivariate approaches make fewer assumptions than the classical approach, but in general are less powerful when the assumptions that the classical approach requires are met. The newest approach uses mixed models, which may not require as stringent assumptions as the classical approach, and under some circumstances may be more powerful and flexible than the multivariate approach. In this paper, we define repeated measures designs, and discuss their analysis with both PROC GLM and PROC MIXED. Definitions A repeated measures design is one in which at least one of the factors consists of repeated measurements on the same subjects or experimental units, under different conditions. Such a factor is commonly called a withinsubjects, factor. A between-subjects factor is one in which each level of the factor contains different experimental units. In this paper, we will concentrate on experimental designs with both within-subjects and between-subjects factors. In a repeated factor, the repeated measurements are not simply replicates of each other, but there is some sort of qualitative or quantitative relationship among the levels of that factor. A repeated measures experiment differs from one in which the mul",p58.pdf
"1 The Building Blocks of PROC TABULATE PROC TABULATE Ron Coleman Links Analytical, Inc. There are a number of basic concepts that need to be understood before you can expect to work effectively with TABULATE. Without a thorough knowledge of the keywords and operators TABULATE can be very difficult. A little time and a building block approach will make this complex SAS ® procedure easier to use and understand. First, our example data set. Our data is from a fictional company, Educational Demos, for 1995 and 1996. The company has clients in 6 states broken into North and South regions. The North region includes the states Connecticut, Maine, and Massachusetts. The South region includes Alabama, Florida, and Georgia. Here is a partial PROC CONTENTS listing of the TABDATA data set.

", Cary, NC Mark Brown, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC Abstract Enterprise Miner  software is the data mining solution from SAS Institute Inc. This paper discusses three main features of Enterprise Minerthe graphical user interface (GUI), the SEMMA methodology, and client/server enablementand maps the components of the solution to those features. Introduction Data mining is a process; not just a series of statistical analyses. Simply applying disparate software tools to a data mining project can take one only so far. Instead, what is needed to plan, implement, and successfully refine a data mining project is an integrated software solutionone that encompasses all steps of the process beginning with the sampling of data, through sophisticated data analyses and modeling, to the dissemination of the resulting business-critical information. In addition, the ideal solution should be intuitive and flexible enough that users with different degrees of statistical expertise can understand and use it. To accomplish all this, the data mining solution must provide  advanced, yet easy-to-use, statistical analyses and reporting techniques  a guiding, yet flexible, methodology  client/server enablement. SAS ® Enterprise Miner  software is that solution. It synthesizes the world-renowned statistical analysis and reporting system of SAS Institute with an easy-touse GUI that can be understood and used by business analysts as well as quantitative experts.

"Introduction One of the most powerful features of SAS software is the ability to read data in almost any form. For example, you can have data values separated by blanks or other delimiters or you can arrange your data in columns, using one or more lines of data for each subject. You can also read selected data fields and then decide how to read the remaining data values. This tutorial will give you an overview of the immense power and flexibility of the SAS INPUT statement. Reading Space Delimited Data A common form of data entry is to separate each data value by one or more spaces. This is handy for small data sets that are entered by hand, especially for test purposes. This arrangement of data is often called ""list directed"" data. The rule here is that you must specify all the variables in the data lines and all the data values must be separated by one or more spaces. You must also indicate which variables are to be read as character data. Look at the following example: ***LIST DIRECTED INPUT; DATA LIST;    INPUT X Y A $ Z; DATALINES; 1 2 HELLO 3 4     5     GOODBYE   6 ; PROC PRINT DATA=LIST;    TITLE 'LIST DIRECTED INPUT'; RUN; Notice that you need to list the variable names on the INPUT statement and to place a dollar sign ($) after any variable that is to hold character values. Also notice that the second line of data which has multiple spaces between each data value causes no problems at all. Delimiters Other Than Spaces With just a small change to the program, you can indicate any delimiter you like, in place of the default blank. To understand how this works, we need to jump ahead a bit to see how a SAS program reads data from an external data file (as opposed to data following a DATALINES statement). You do this by including an INFILE statement which tells the program where to find the data. The INFILE statement has several options that provide additional information on how to read these external data lines, one of them being an option to define a delimite",p61.pdf

"As the banking industry continues its trend of record breaking mergers and acquisitions, the systems that provide these companies with critical business information become more complex. The focus has turned from product and branch performance to understanding and predicting behaviors of individual customers. This customer centric approach has created the need for business units within the bank to look at new levels of detail in the corporate data store. In turn, Information Technology (IT) groups must respond to the demand by capturing more detailed information from operational systems and make it available in an understandable format that supports this new focus. The SAS system is used strategically throughout the banking industry for numerous applications from CPU performance in the data center to financial reporting and consolidation for executives. This paper will focus on the data warehousing and data mining initiatives that support the customer focused approach to doing business.",p63.pdf
"Introduction The MERGE statement is one of the first statements a SAS ® programmer learns. However merges can take a considerable amount of processing time, especially when only a few records of a 10 million record dataset are needed. This paper will discuss how and where the MERGE statement can be replaced with a keyed lookup routine often reducing I/O and CPU usage by over 90 percent. Scenario The Bogus Bulb Company, a purveyor of questionable quality garden bulbs, has a clientele of over ten million gardeners across the U.S. Periodically the Company's marketing department creates special promotions targeting a select number of customers which will usually consist of no more than 10 percent of their total clientele. These target customers, known only by their customer numbers, are selected based on various criteria including frequency of purchases, kind and number of   bulbs purchased, climate zone, etc. Once selected, the customer numbers are then given to the sales department in the form of a SAS dataset in order to create the customer mailing list off of the company's demographics dataset. Currently the demographics dataset is sorted by the variables ZIPCODE, STATE, CITY, contains the variable CUSTNO (which is unique), ADDRESS1 and ADDRESS2 (which are not unique), is updated once a week, and is not indexed. The target dataset is sorted by CUSTNO which is unique. Addresses of the targeted customers are obtained by resorting the ten million plus records in the demographics dataset and then merging them with the target dataset. A process that takes a considerable amount of space and resources. Creating the Index According to SAS, indexes are not recommended for ' WHERE-expression processing if you expect to retrieve more than one-third of the observations in the dataset '. Even though in this case we will not be doing any WHERE-expression processing, the same principle applies for direct access processing. It has already been stipulated earlier that no more than t",p64.pdf

"Dynamically Build a PROC FORMAT for Subsetting Large Datasets Warren E. Stinson Director, Analytical Processes Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. How do you pass through a vary large master file extracting specific records by account number without coding the Boolean logic or doing a SAS merge on the file? This paper addresses a method to dynamically build a PROC FORMAT and utilize that format with the DATA step to extract the requested records. This method for subsetting the file can be used independently of changes to the master list of account numbers being constantly changed by the user. To dynamically build the PROC FORMAT, the following steps need to take place. The first DATA step will read the account number file and write our a SAS file. (Note: Most files used in my facility are raw data files.) A PROC SORT is then built to sort the records and remove duplicate account numbers. The second DATA step reads the sorted file and writes the file to a temporary data set in the form of a PROC FORMAT value statement. The PROC FORMAT is then called into the job stream using the %INCLUDE statement. The format is referenced further down the job stream in another DATA step in conjunction with a PUT statement. EXAMPLE: DATA TRANS; INFILE TRANS; INPUT @1 ACCOUNT 9.; PROC SORT DATA=TRANS NODUPS; BY ACCOUNT; DATA _NULL_; SET TRANS END=EOF; FILE TEMP; IF _N_ = 1 THEN PUT @1 VALUE MATCH; IF EOF = 0 THEN PUT @1 ACCOUNT Z9. ,; ELSE PUT @1 ACCOUNT Z9. = 1 /           @1 OTHER = 0;; PROC FORMAT; %INCLUDE TEMP; DATA _NULL_; INFILE MASTER; INPUT @1 ACCOUNT 9.               @15 FIELDS $CHAR19.; FILE OUTFILE; IF PUT(ACCOUNT,ACCOUNT.) = 1 THEN   PUT @1 ACCOUNT Z9.           @10 FIELDS $CHAR19.; ELSE RETURN; Coders© Corner       Coders© Corner",p66.pdf

"Introduction Until the development of enhanced numeric informats, the only way to read a combination of character and numeric data was to read all data values as character data, check the value, and convert to numeric if necessary. We will demonstrate two programs that read a combination of character and numeric values, each using the ""old-fashioned"" method and using an enhanced numeric informat. Example 1 - ""Old-fashioned"" Method For this example, we want to read some temperatures. However, instead of writing 98.6 every time a ""normal"" temperature was recorded, the letter 'N' was recorded instead. Here is a program that processes these data the ""oldfashioned"" way: DATA TEMPER;    INPUT DUMMY $ @@;    IF DUMMY = 'N' THEN TEMP = 98.6;    ELSE TEMP = INPUT(DUMMY,8.);    DROP DUMMY; DATALINES; 101.5 N 95.8 N 102.2 ; Notice that each data value is first read as character data. If the value is an 'N', the value of the temperature variable (TEMP) is set to 98.6. If the value is anything else, the INPUT function is used to perform a character to numeric conversion. Remember to drop the character variable from the resulting data set. Example 1 - Using an Enhanced Numeric Informat Here is a program that accomplishes the same goal, using an enhanced numeric informat: PROC FORMAT;    INVALUE T 'N' = 98.6             OTHER = _SAME_; RUN; DATA TEMPER;    INFORMAT TEMP T.;    INPUT TEMP @@; DATALINES; 101.5 N 95.8 N 102.2 ; We use PROC FORMAT for create a userdefined informat using an INVALUE statement. Notice the values to the left of the equal sign can be either character values (placed in quotes), or numeric values or ranges. Example 2 - ""Old-fashioned"" Way For this example, lead levels are entered from three different laboratories. Each of the three laboratories has a different non-detect value. For lab A, it is .05, for lab B, .1, and for lab C, .2. Each time a non-detect value is encountered, an 'A', 'B', or 'C' is entered. In addition, any value over 50 is considered a dat",p69.pdf

"eractive SAS® session, it is necessary to create temporary external files. From release 6.11 of the SAS System we have the ability to create a flat file within the same directory that contains SAS data sets. There are benefits to using this new technique. This paper will show you how to define this file in the WORK directory and the benefits of its use. INTRODUCTION It is easy to create a permanent file using a LIBNAME statement for SAS data sets or a FILENAME statement for external files. However, each operating system has its own mechanism for creating a file that is temporary in nature. By definition, a temporary file, whether it is a SAS data set or an external file, is one that is deleted at the end of the SAS session. In the MVS operating system, this is true. When a file is defined with an ampersand as its first character (e.g., &MYTEMP) it is deleted at the end of a batch job or an interactive SAS session. For example, temporary files can be defined as follows: LIBNAME SASTEMP &TEMP; -orFILENAME FLATEMP &TEMP; Unfortunately, the personal computer (PC) operating systems do not react in the same manner. If a file is defined, as in the example above, the file would reside on the hard drive in the current directory. In the PC environment, space and memory are important, limited resources. Therefore, removal of unneeded files becomes extremely urgent. To remove these files would require manual intervention. You can use an X statement to issue an operating system comman",p71.pdf
"Abstract Complex character comparisons - comparisons of character values in a data set against a number of character constants which vary in length - are easier specified than coded. For example, how would you select the records of customers whose last names begin with 'Mc' or 'Mac'? How would you select the records of customers who live in ZIP codes beginning with 010 through 0131? This paper will show you how to use the IN operator and the colon (:) operator modifier to code these comparisons simply and clearly. A Sample Comparison To illustrate this discussion, lets use a more realistic version of the ZIP code comparison. Suppose we have to select the records for all the customers located in ZIP codes which begin with: 010 011 012 0131 0133 0134 0136 0138 The difficulty is that we want to select some records based on the first three bytes of the ZIP code, others based on the first four bytes. Some Cluttered Solutions One frequently used way of selecting the correct records is to use the SUBSTR (Substring) function to truncate the values of the variable: Data Select ; set Customer ; if substr( ZIP_code, 1, 3 ) = 010 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 3 ) = 011 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 3 ) = 012 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 4 ) = 0131 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 4 ) = 0133 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 4 ) = 0134 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 4 ) = 0136 or    substr( ZIP_code, 1, 4 ) = 0138 ; This approach certainly does the job but the code is verbose",p72.pdf

This value can then be used to select data subsets based on this relationship.

"1 The 'SKIP' Statement Paul Grant, Private Healthcare Systems, Inc. The Problem Sooner or later every SAS® programmer faces the irritating problem of running only a portion of an existing SAS program. If you're a craftsman with respect to your code, you can't use bracket-style comments ( /* .... */ ) to block segments of code from execution because you've already used them to document your program and bracket-style comments can't be nested. For example, we all know what would happen if we tried to use bracket-style comments to prevent the following data step from being executed. /* DATA SALARY ; /* ASSIGN COMMISSION RATES */ more SAS statements RUN ;       */ The */ after the word RATES would end the comment which began on the first line so the statements after RATES */ would generate an error. Clearly, not the intended result. Comment statements ( *.. ; ) will do the job but, except in small programs, theyre too impractical to use. Its simply too tedious to put an asterisk in front of a lot of SAS statements and remove them when youre done. What we really need is a SKIP statement. Like a comment statement, a SKIP statement would block lines of SAS code from being compiled and executed by the SAS Supervisor. But unlike statement-style comments, the SKIP statement would hide multiple SAS statements from the SAS Supervisor. And unlike bracket-style comments, SKIP statements could be nested. The Solution You'll be pleased to know that this capability already exists in the SAS language - not as an undocumented feature, just an unimagined one. And as the following example shows, you can easily code one yourself. SAS statements you want to execute..... %macro SKIP ; SAS statements you want to skip..... %mend SKIP ; SAS statements you want to execute..... How It Works This tip works by asking the SAS macro facility to store the portion of code that you don't want to execute as a SAS macro. If the 'SKIP' macro is never called in the program, it is never passed to",p76.pdf
"What We Really Need is a %BY Statement Ray Pass, ASG, Inc Heres the scenario. You have to produce a series of different reports from the same overall population, and each report has to be run separately for each level of a specified bygroup (or combination of bygroups) in the population. The catch is that the client (boss, whatever) wants the report output to appear in bygroup order; i.e. all reports for bygroup-1, then all reports for bygroup-2, etc. Another catch is that you dont necessarily know a priori what the different levels of the bygroup are, or even how many there are; in fact, this is to be part of a routine production system where these bygroup levels will most assuredly be changing from run to run.

This approach requires only a single entry of the parameters for multiple usage.

"of the most significant features of macro facility within the SAS System is its ability to make internal and dynamic updates possible. This paper will introduce a utility macro which can be used to update a two-dimentional matrix dynamically and internally. The macro code demonstrates how to use some very important macro functions and macro statements in the SAS macro language and related techniques to solve the complicated real world problems. 1. Introduction The potential pay-back for time and efforts invested in well-designed, modular generic utility macros can be very large in creating very sophisticated self-modifying programs for gaining efficiency and accuracy, especially for the routine file maintenance. When one maintains a large macro-based information system, usually there are many macro variables needed to be updated each time period, for example, each month. In order to update the information accurately and efficiently, utility macros are definitely helpful during file maintenance. With this kind of utility macros, macro variables in the system can be dynamically and internally updated during program compilation. This short paper consists of four sections. The first section, closing here, provides a brief introduction to the need for file maintenance. Section 2 describes the requirements from a real world problem.

The SAS macro language is a useful tool for developing utility applications that can be reused on different projects to perform common tasks. This paper illustrates how the SAS macro language can be used in combination with PROC CONTENTS to create a simple SAS source code generator.

In order to accomplish any of these tasks you would need to obtain a list of files. This macro produces a macro variable with a list of all of the files in a directory. It may be further restricted to produce a list of files of a given extension in that directory. In the course of presenting this macro the following techniques will be covered:  X (host command),  && for delayed processing,  &&& for ampersanding the contents of a macro variable. Special provisions have been made so that a list of files longer than the 200 character limit for character variables may be created.

"The SAS manuals and guides provide good information about using CALL SYMPUT to write data values to the macro environment, and, then, to retrieve those values in subsequent DATA steps or PROC s. Even so, it is easy to write seemingly valid code, only to find that the results are not as expected; or to use the same block of code in slightly different contexts, only to find that one works, while the other does not. Much of the confusion in such situations can be attributed to an insufficient understanding of what SAS is doing in the SYMPUT routine. Through a series of examples using CALL SYMPUT statements, we will illustrate how SAS processes macro variables and discuss the considerations for handling character, numeric and null values within or between DATA steps.",p83.pdf

This is especially true in the United States, where telecommunications, the Internet, video and audio services all fall under the larger umbrella of the information superhighway. Our project team is adept at providing customized business solutions to telecommunications managers by creating specialized information systems to meet their individual needs. We design personalized systems that transcend the boundaries of traditional data warehousing systems by gathering and storing important data, analyzing and transforming the data, and then summarizing and reordering it in accordance with the demands of the user. This provides a dynamic and efficient frontend presentation and reporting tools that transform the users from reactive recipients of hard copy reports to competitive executives poised to make efficient, wellinformed decisions.

Explanations of the many data warehouse concepts will be given. The Goal of This Paper: The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to data warehousing concepts and terms. It will briefly define concepts such as OLTP, OLAP, enterprise-wide data warehouse, data marts, dimensional models, fact tables, dimension tables, and the star join schema. The present study will also explore the implementation of a data mart for an outpatient clinical information system using the star schema After reviewing the concepts and approaches, one will conclude that the SAS family of products offers an end to end solution for data warehousing. Why Implement a Data Warehouse or Data Mart? In the past, a common system application has been of the OLTP kind: On-line Transaction Processing. Examples of OLTP systems are accounting, payroll, and billing systems where the lowest level of information is a transaction. These OLTP systems are at the heart of running an operation or department of a firm. In my belief, many of these basic operational needs have been satisfied by OLTP systems in place. These systems contain vast amounts of data which can be difficult to access. However, this data is still critical for decision makers to better manage a firm.

"ct A recent project at Research Triangle Institute (RTI) involved a large transportation survey that required validating and packaging of the data, in the form of ASCII text files and SAS data sets, for use by the public domain. In addition, a detailed codebook was produced for each edited file, which included a frequency distribution for categorical data and descriptive statistics for continuous data, along with the usual information concerning data attributes. In order to facilitate the process of generating a codebook for each edited file, RTI developed a SAS application that allowed those people involved with the project to produce the codebook independently. Upon creating the codebook listing, the member of the project team, or end-user, would export the listing from SAS creating a RTF (Rich Text Format) file, then, import the RTF file into a Word document producing the finished deliverable. This paper explains the SAS solution that generates the codebooks for a large survey project. The Process The transportation survey consists of many pages of raw data that produces different files consisting of 3,000 to 400,000 records and 30 to over 200 variables. Each file requires many validation checks that begin the rigorous task of cleaning the data. Once the data have been validated, two deliverable files are produced: an ASCII text file and a SAS data set. Finally, an in-house SAS application creates a detailed codebook representing the deliverable files. The In-house Applica",p9.pdf
"Data Warehouse: How to use SAS from Beginning to Almost Ending for Your Warehouse January 7, 1998   The University of Arkansas at Fayetteville first began exploring the development and implementation of data warehousing in November, 1995. In under two years, the Computing Services Department has moved from conceptual modeling, through prototyping, to a working, evolving production system for data storage and retrieval  all at a substantial savings in time, money and resources. Paramount in this endeavor has been the use of SAS ® software. From the system administration tools to those maintaining the secure server, the University of Arkansas development team found in a single software suite what previously had only been available as separate, much more expensive packages. In addition, the new SAS ® ODBC drivers insure that end-users can directly retrieve, massage and report from the nowcentralized data with any ODBC-compliant software package, including of course, SAS ® itself. This paper will present a review of the data warehouse implementation on the Fayetteville campus, as well as an outlook for the future.   The Department of Computing Services provides computing facilities in support of instruction, research, and administration to University of Arkansas students, faculty, and staff. An important component of this mission is to develop comprehensive information systems and pursue reengineering of ongoing systems in support of university information needs. Initially, this support came in the form of mainframe on-line and batch-reporting systems. Then PC, Macintosh ® and networked desktop applications came on-line. These were and are still in use, a vital part of day-to-day functioning within individual departments. However, as computing needs of the campus expanded, it soon became apparent that what was needed was the ability to truly share meaningful data campus-wide in such a way that end users  from the departmental level to senior administration  could ind",p90.pdf

"Data warehouse projects involve populating databases with unique subsets of records. These record subsets are frequently extracted from much larger sets that can sometimes contain many millions of records. This paper focuses on data extractions based on lookup tables, which can be implemented using several different techniques.

The results of this study can help guide the warehouse designer's decisions regarding sorting, indexing, and choice of an extraction method.",p92.pdf
"ment of Social Welfare, Wellington, New Zealand ABSTRACT SAS/ACCESS ® to Oracle ® provides facilities to treat an Oracle database as if its a series of SAS data sets. Experience in a data warehouse environment has shown that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed to maximize some of the options available for performance improvement to update and query access. One of the major components of the New Zealand Department of Social Welfares data warehouse is the replication of an 80 gigabyte database from Unisys  DMS II into Oracle on a UNIX platform. Analysts use SAS on this warehouse for query access. But it has also been used to create the Oracle database, and to maintain the database replica in step with the Unisys system. Because of the extensive quantities of data that are being dealt with here, it has been necessary to undertake some testing in order to optimize the SAS access to Oracle. This paper presents some of the findings from this work. The paper describes different methods of accessing Oracle with SAS, the use of syntax to control what gets passed through to Oracle, and the results of running the same tests against SAS and Oracle. BACKGROUND Environment The data warehouse is based on a UNIX platform: an HP9000/K570, recently upgraded from a K460, with six 64 bit PA8200 processors. There are 633 gigabytes of available disk space provided by twelve disk arrays operating in RAID5, and two gigabytes of RAM. The platform operating system is HP-UX versio",p93.pdf

"ABSTRACT Many companies that developed their own clinical data management systems in the 80s and early 90s settled on a model that enters and stores data in an On Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) oriented Relational Data Base Management System (RDBMS) and then moves that data to the SAS ® System for analysis. This choice was made for a number of reasons: many information technology (IT) professionals did not consider SAS software to be a true relational database; companies selected their clinical data management systems at a time when the SAS system lacked certain relevant features found in traditional RDBMS systems; MIS departments involved in the selection of a database tended to chose the tools with which they were already familiar. The original purpose of an RDBMS was to manage a companys operational data in the form of individual transactions. In recent years, IT professionals have come to recognize strategic information delivery as a second purpose for RDBMS systems and with this realization came a new term: the Data Warehouse. Although it still lacks certain OLTP features, the SAS system is an award winning Data Warehouse. With the advent of the Orlando II release of the SAS system (SAS 6.12), application developers now have all the tools necessary to construct clinical data management systems that match the very best systems built with OLTP software feature for feature, but which exceed them by facilitating the job of reporting the results of clinical trials to regulatory agencies. This paper contrasts the differences between OLTP and Data Warehouse systems and shows how using a Data Warehouse model and software such as the SAS system rather than an OLTP model can have important and beneficial consequences with respect to streamlining and accelerating new drug development, and integrating clinical data review and CANDA development into the clinical data management process.

"The Transfusion-Transmitted Virus Study (TTVS) was a National Heart Lung Blood Institute (NHLBI) sponsored investigation during the 1970s of characteristics of blood donors and recipients in four geographic areas of the United States. Its immediate purpose was to determine the incidence of transfusiontransmitted hepatitis viruses during that time. Another major purpose was to develop a long-term database and serum repository to be used subsequently to answer questions for agents for which there was no method of testing at that time. The original database was stored in SAS, so that any investigator who wanted to use the information either had to be able to program in SAS or obtain the assistance of a SAS programmer. With the development over the past decade of assays for many new hepatitis and other viruses, a large amount of new data were added to the database. In addition, many questions about these involved choosing subsets of donors and recipients with particular characteristics. As a result, the study found a need for an investigator unfamiliar with SAS programming to have methods of easily accessing the data, an ability to retrieve information quickly, to perform simple statistical procedures, and be able to depict the data in report and graphical formats. Because it could satisfy those complex requirements, the SAS System, Version 6.12 (Windows NT), was selected as the development tool for the TTVS database. This presentation will demonstrate in tandem how AF/FRAME and Screen Control Language (SCL) were employed to build a user-friendly system.",p96.pdf

"OUT OF THE MAINFRAME & INTO THE WEB: THE TRIALS AND TRIBULATIONS OF PORTING SAS MAINFRAME APPLICATIONS TO THE WEB Thomas E. Link, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, RTP, NC Thomas A. Dessent, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Contractor to US EPA Pranav K. Patel, Lockheed Martin Corporation, Contractor to US EPA. M. Arthur Alexander III, SAS Institute, Cary, NC INTRODUCTION Our Journey Begins with a Database Named AIRS The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) depends on information  lots of it  to carry out its mission to protect and improve the nation's air quality. EPA's main collection of computerized information about air pollution is AIRS, the Aerometric Information Retrieval System.   AIRS is the mother of all air pollution databases and the most respected source for this information in the world. Values in the AIRS database tell how much pollution is released into the air by industry, commerce, and just plain folks. Other values tell the ambient concentration of pollutants in the air we breathe, and still more values tell what administrative and legal actions have been taken to fix pollution problems. EPA gives the 50 states and many local environmental agencies direct access to all the AIRS data, and direct control of their own data. By analyzing the values in AIRS, EPA and the states can determine the ""health"" of our air, where the problems are, and how well remedial actions are working.  All of these are good things. In the late 1980's more and more people began talking about visualizing data temporally and spatially  GIS and stuff like that. Yes, even back then, the need to understand and visualize trends in large databases REALLY QUICKLY, was beginning to creep into our ordinary daily lives! Our team looked at GIS and knew that was too much horsepower for the majority of our data owners and users.

"( From Input Statements to Data Forms) Bernd E. Imken, Patented Medicine Prices Review Board, Government of Canada, Ottawa, Canada Abstract: During a recent SAS ® Users Group presentation in Ottawa the audience was asked to identify how they input/edit/view data. 50% said they use the Data step and Proc Print, another 45% said they used Proc FSEDIT, FSVIEW or VIEWTABLE, 5% said they developed custom AF screens. Out of this 5%, only one user said that they have experimented with Data Forms and Data Tables. The purpose of this paper is to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each approach and in particular to show why organizations such as the Patented Medicine Prices Review Board (PMPRB) benefit so significantly by using the more recently developed SAS facilities for user interaction. This paper describes how the Board evolved over the last 10 years. You may find that your organization is currently at some point on this same development time line.

"For the long term follow-up of an international, epidemiological study, 4000 cardiac surgery patients responses to interview questions are recorded on interview answer sheets. The responses are processed and saved in SAS ® database via a SAS/AF ® data entry application. This application has the following features. - It adopts a GUI approach to data entry using Data Form and Data Table objects in SAS/AF FRAME ® software, version 6.12. The two objects provide a graphical interface and more Screen Control Language flexibility when browsing and editing data than the FSVIEW and FSEDIT procedures in SAS/FSP ® software allow. - User authentication is checked automatically upon login and a set of privileges is granted to the user accordingly. This determines whether the SAS data sets are open at editing mode for data entry or only at browsing mode. - Integrity constraints such as primary key and foreign key inherited from an ORACLE ® database are enforced into the SAS database at application level.

"Use PROC SQL to Collapse Cells  Its Easy Tamara Hagemeier, Yue-Hwa Chang, Bureau of Labor Statistics 1                                                     1 Any opinions in this paper are those of the authors and do not constitute policy of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I. Introduction During data processing it may become necessary to group data records in order to perform a procedure. The grouped records form cells that may be used to test some general condition about the grouped records. If the quantity of data within a cell is insufficient then cells are combined until sufficient data exist for valid inference. The Consumer Expenditure Survey at the Bureau of Labor Statistics has developed a program to collapse cells by using SAS ® PROC SQL. The PROC SQL program collapses cells in an order defined by the user, keeps a record of all collapsed cells, and retains the original and the collapsed cell values. There are three types of input parameters to the collapsing program: classification variables, sufficiency criteria, and collapsing order. All parameters are supplied by the user and easily changed. Survey data is put into cells defined by classification variables such as, family size, tenure, and race. The sufficiency criteria may take on many forms such as, the number of records or units in a cell, the total weight of the cell, the ratio of one type of record to another, or any combination of above. The collapsing order indicates which cells should be combined if a cell fails the sufficiency criteria. II. Cell Defining Variables For the Consumer Expenditure Survey application, each record is placed into cells based on tenure, family size, and race. Table 1 shows the 16 possible cells. Each record should be categorized into one and only one of the sixteen cells.

"rogram documentation. As companies that use SAS grow, so does the number of SAS programs that they must manage. This can quickly become a frightening task since SAS programs are so easy to set up and run. In the course of a few weeks, hundreds of SAS programs can emerge, and with no good method of documenting them, finding the right program at the right time can be impossible. INTRODUCTION To address this problem, our team decided to create a standard program header that contained program-specific information such as author, client, project, etc.  The header was included in all new programs and added to some existing ones.  Having such a standard has turned out to be extremely useful in more ways than we had imagined. Four practical applications of using a standard header are outlined in this paper. THE HEADER We use the following lines of code as our standard program header.

"Abstract Most of the papers at SUGI and other SAS ® conferences are presented using Microsoft PowerPoint, and a few more are presented with Lotus Freelance Graphics. Both presentation tools are very powerful, and can produce very impressive final results, but both suffer from the same flaw when presenting SAS papers: They are not compatible with the SAS System! In version 6.12 SAS/EIS ® software now includes its own presentation tool, SAS/PRESENTS ® software, which, while it is nowhere near as comprehensive a presentation tool as its rivals, is totally integrated into the SAS System, allowing SAS programs to be demonstrated seamlessly with little impact on memory as only one application needs to be in use, the SAS System. This paper describes and demonstrates some of the uses and limitations of this new component of SAS/EIS software, so that, in the future, more papers will be presented using SAS/PRESENTS software. Simple text and graphics presentations SAS/PRESENTS software can be used to either develop or show slide presentations. The development environment can be started from either the SAS Desktop, using the Presentation Builder icon in the Presentation group, or by typing: PRESENT on the Command Line. The presentation can then be shown from within the development environment, or by typing: PRESENT RUN 'filename' on the Command Line. The basic layout of Title, Subtitle, Text, Image, Graph and Hotspot objects is determined by the 9 supplied Templates. These can then been altered after selection, by adding, moving or removing objects, to create the slide layout you require. Graphic fonts and colours of the text in Title, Subtitle and Text objects can be changed at any time, but the changes only affect text subsequently added, not the current text.

"useful and versatile procedure for producing tables and listings. There are several enhancements that I wanted in my reports, which I could not find in the manual. I produce many reports and I wanted to automatically break-up reports with solid lines, add customised page numbering and conditional footnotes. This paper outlines my solutions. It is targeted at those who have had some previous experience with Proc Report. Introduction PROC REPORT is my report generator of choice as it is more versatile than PROC PRINT and TABULATE, its ability to flow text is extremely useful and it is much easier to use than PUT statements in a data step. However the manual does not explain how to do some things that I must have in my reports. These are how to:  break up sections of the report with solid lines  number the pages of report in the form Page x of y immediately at the foot the report  add footnotes conditional on the contents of the current page of the report In this paper I will show you how put these in my reports. All examples in this paper have been tried and tested in version 6.12 of the SAS ® system. Breaking up sections of the report with solid lines. My boss likes a solid line spanning the entire report to break up sections and a double solid line to signify the end of the report. It is not to difficult to produce report breaks with lines going across the page every time a variable changes or conditionally changing the line type. This can be done with a control variab",p080-24.pdf

"include page numbering, which is readily available using the NUMBER option in SAS®. But, there is no option that would include the total number of pages, along with the page number, having the format Page 13 of 145, for example. At least, not without substantial effort by the programmer. This paper explains several macros that includes the total number of pages as part of customizing the pagination of SAS® output. Introduction In the real world of doing data analysis, SAS® often produces reports consisting of hundreds of pages of output. And, sometimes, it is imperative to know how many pages comprise a report, making sure that you have all the output. Currently, SAS® does not provide pagination that includes any customizing features or, even, the total number of pages. At best, you can use the NUMBER option and the PAGENO option to specify pagination and to reset page numbering, respectively. Obtaining pagination that includes the total number of pages requires programming outside the scope of the analytical task, in order to make the report more acceptable and complete.   Using the SAS® Macro Language, several macros were developed to solve this task of paginating SAS® output.

"el), Digital Intelligence Systems, Centreville, VA ABSTRACT The SAS Systems ® Base product supports TCP/IP socket communication access method as a filename parameter since Release 6.11. Two processes running on different hosts, say PC and Unix, can set up ports to communicate by TCP/IP sockets. With the aid of the SAS Web Publishing Tools ® , a Perl ® program can be implemented for dynamic display of SAS data on the Internet. INTRODUCTION TCP/IP socket communication access method is an integral part of networking environment today. It has been implemented on many operating systems, such as on MVS ® , Unix, and PC. Software languages and packages from many vendors, such as SAS, C/C++, Visual Basic ® , Java ® , and Perl, support it. This paper aims to demonstrate how to use SAS sockets in client/server applications. OVERVIEW OF SOCKET, AS IMPLEMENTED IN SAS A socket is like a telephone for two persons to talk and listen. Two processes can communicate by setting up a socket with a common port number. However if both processes simultaneously wanting to send i.e. talk, or to receive i.e. listen, deadlock can result. Base SAS supports TCP/IP socket communication access method as a filename parameter. As implemented in the SAS System, a socket can be used only to send or to receive, i.e. one direction only. The syntax clearly indicates for sending or for receiving: /* A socket for receiving: */ Filename receiver SOCKET :portno SERVER <tcpipoptions>; /* A socket for sending: */ Fi",p083-24.pdf
"usses techniques for generating SAS/Graph ® on remote host, then sending it back to the web server machine for display on the Internet. INTRODUCTION Problem: SAS/IntrNet ® is licensed on local host, but huge amount of corporate data resides on remote host, say MVS ® . How to produce graph based on remote data for Internet display dynamically and without waiting forever? With SAS/Connect ® licensed, we can, from a local interactive SAS session, remote submit programs to generate graph for display on local host. However, if the local SAS session is being run in batch mode or under SAS/IntrNets control, then changes are needed to properly retrieve graphs from the remote host. Secondly since textual or graphical reports are usually smaller in size than the actual data, its better to produce report on the host where the data resides, then to transfer only the report across network. WHY NOT USE REMOTE LIBRARY SERVICE? For example, Libname libref server= remote_host.SAS_Share_server; Goptions device= gif gsfname= _webout; Proc gchart data= libref.SAS_data; Run; Remote library service, by definition, brings data from remote host down to local host for processing. In most enterprise, network speed is the bottleneck. With SAS/Connect, we can take advantage of the remote hosts processing power while transfer only a fraction of data across network. Also when many simultaneous requests coming from the Internet, either IntrNet or Share ® servers may become saturated, causing difficulty",p084-24.pdf
"U S West analysts use counters on many of their web pages to monitor the use of internal reporting tools. The information from these counters indicates whether a  tool is meeting the needs of the customer, and possibly whether the analyst should even continue maintaining the tool. In the move to use dynamic web reports created with SAS/IntrNet software as opposed to static HTML files and Perl scripts, the assumption was that counters based on Perl scripts would still be used.   However, counters can be created using simple techniques through SAS/IntrNet tools and base SAS software, keeping the programming consistent, and giving the analyst easy access to data that can be instrumental in determining work priorities. Data retrieved from counter data sets can easily be plotted with SAS/GRAPH® software to find out whether usage is increasing or decreasing, and to also find out patterns of fluctuation.",p085-24.pdf
"This paper describes a macro tool that searches character variables for specified text strings and replaces them with other text strings. This macro is especially useful if the search string occurs multiple times within different character values. For example, if you simply wanted to replace ""ABD."" with ""ABDOMINAL"", and you knew that in every instance the character value only contained one word, you could use a simple ""if"" statement to perform the search and replace (i.e., if text = ""ABD."" then newtext = ""ABDOMINAL""). However, if ""ABD."" was present in multiple contexts  for instance, ABD. CRAMPING"", ""ABD. ASCITES"", ""ABD.

But how can we retrieve all or specific tables in a database without repeated operations or tedious programming? This paper discusses how the use of a macro ODBC2SAS and ODBC administrator can achieve this task. INTRODUCTION In our research projects, we often need to efficiently retrieve different databases and analyze them in SAS system. This paper discusses one macro I developed for building our data management system. The macro ODBC2SAS uses SQL Procedure Pass-through facility to make the SAS/ACCESS ® interface to ODBC and SQL Server and read in all or specific tables in the ODBC database automatically. Use of the macro ODBC2SAS enables our researchers to rapidly retrieve any information in the projects DOE_H and OHIO without tedious programming, such as typing hundreds of tables names, and even without knowing anything about the database. Before use of this macro, you need to be familiar with how the DBMS and SAS System work in your operating environment. The SAS/ACCESS ® Interface to ODBC and the ODBC driver of the DBMS (here is MS Access provided by Microsoft) must be installed, and then the data source description file must be set up in ODBC administrator.

"The Automated Input Interface (AII) was created as a tool for the intermediate base SAS ® software user in order to facilitate batch processing of raw data through the specification of a simple set of parameters, rather than through the direct creation of syntax. A special data set, termed the AII control data set, is used in conjunction with SAS System macro code to produce the syntax necessary to create system data sets from raw data. The AII control data set determines the data set names, variable names, and variable types for the conversion of raw data sets to SAS System data sets. Thus, all data sets that are created with the AII and that exist in multiple projects are consistent and can readily be included in automated restructuring, merging, analyzing, routing, and reporting. AII offers the greatest advantage when many projects are dependent on large data sources which are stored in multiple record structures and physical locations (e.g. tapes). The input of any number of new raw data records can be achieved through the one time addition of information to an AII control data set. AII also handles the repetition of input syntax, and the creation of any combination of multiple data sets from within one DATA step.",p090-24.pdf

One of the most important aspects of the SAS Window is its ability to create a user-friendly customized window for a novice SAS programmer to run routine programs dynamically. You may get results from a computer without necessarily having any particular programming skill. INTRODUCTION A menu is a list of choices that you can select from. The easiest way to implement a menu is to associate a code, a character or number, with each option. You enter one of the codes in the selection field.

"hicago, IL ABSTRACT Have you ever needed to create a format for a variable that required a large number of ranges? If so, you have probably discovered how tedious the use of PROC FORMAT can become. This paper illustrates a macro that can create a numeric format easily and quickly using SAS® software. The method used by the macro and the logic behind it are explained. The CNTLIN option in PROC FORMAT is described. INTRODUCTION In data analysis, there is often a need to break a continuous variable into a small number of distinct ranges or categories. The output may be a frequency table with the variable split into these ranges, or the result may be means of another variable by these ranges. The set of rules describing the values that fall into each range is called a format. Typically, PROC FORMAT is used to create a format. For variables requiring many numeric ranges, tedious coding can be avoided by using a macro instead. This paper presents a macro that creates a numeric format with little coding. USING PROC FORMAT A common method for breaking a variable into categories is to create a format as shown below.    proc format fmtlib;       value dollars    low   - 50  = 'low to 50'    50 < - 100 = '50< to 100'    100 < - 200 = '100< to 200'    200 < - 400 = '200< to 400'    400 < - high = '400< to high'; In this example, the format is called dollars and has five levels. The FMTLIB option produces a format library that details the format created. ----------------------------------",p096-24.pdf

"riable, which requires a great deal of typing, if you have a large number of variables. However, there are some shortcuts. This paper will discuss several ways within the base SAS product to cut down on the amount of typing that is usually done when listing variables. INTRODUCTION Every time you write a program, it is inevitable that you will be creating and using a large number of variables. Every time you need to reference several variables, each must be typed individually. If the list is long, it will require a significant amount of typing. The larger the number of variables to be typed, the greater the possibility of making an error. To avoid errors, it would be nice to have some type of shortcut. This would reduce the amount of typing and the risk of making mistakes. Variable lists are the answer. Variable lists are a list of variable names following a specific format. There are many ways to write a variable list. Of course, you can list every variable. However, there are some shortcuts that you can use to reduce the number of variables that need to be typed. The shortcuts involve using abbreviated variable lists. These techniques are useful after you have defined all of the variables in your DATA step. TYPES OF LISTS There are three kinds of abbreviated lists. It takes a bit of planning to determine which type of list best suits your needs. The key to all of the lists is the manner in which you define your variable names. The three types of lists are the numbered range,",p098-24.pdf
"While hard disk space is amazingly ""cheap"" nowadays, many of us programmers continue to find ourselves working in environments that have significant hard disk constraints. The 'always-ever-increasing-in-size' data set too quickly eats up the hard disk ""real estate"" available to us which will give us immediate and direct access to our data. How many of us have found ourselves spending an inordinate amount of time on trivial, mundane, and unwelcomed tasks such as temporarily compressing or moving our data offline, slicing-and-dicing it, or making some other sort of concession with respect to our data just because there was not enough hard disk space for what we needed to do?   As a result, in order to save disk space, programmers working in a UNIX environment will typically store SAS data sets in UNIX-compressed format. Unfortunately, SAS is unable to directly read a UNIX-compressed, random access, SAS data set. The typical INFILE...PIPE approach does not work with SAS random access (ssd01) files. Programmers are instead forced to uncompress SAS data sets in an entirely separate step prior to reading the data in SAS.

"The use of programming teams offers both advantages and disadvantages when compared with individual programming efforts. The team approach allows a wide range of programming skills and problem-solving perspectives to be applied to a project, and may shorten development time.

Data collection for a face-to-face social survey is being conducted concurrently in five states. Each state has a team of interviewers assigned to cover the addresses of subjects in a particular county. Interviewers report the results of the contacts made each day and the disposition of those contacts is entered into a SAS dataset. The data collection manager needs a daily report summarizing the progress of the survey in terms of the following rates:  contact rate -- number of subjects contacted / total sample  response rate -- number of completed interviews/ eligible sample members  refusal rate -- number of refusals / eligible sample members  cooperation rate -- number of completed interviews / (completed + partial + refused). It is necessary to view these results from various perspectives -- the entire survey area, each state team and the interviewers in each county. Solution:   Just Click My Map Object This application uses the SAS/AF Map Object to display the rates on choropleth & marker maps.

"efield, NJ 07657 ABSTRACT Each SAS programmer in pharmaceutical industry knows how much time it takes to write programs to produce tables and data listings for a new drug application.   Almost every company spent some programming time to facilitate this process and develop some sort of global system of programs that would apply for each study. This presentation demonstrates one part of automated report system: how to produce data listings. This part is built up in SAS Application using SAS/FRAME ® and Screen Control Language.   But right now the author wants to show the hidden process how to generate any kind of listings for customized report and save them in Microsoft ®   Word document. She doesnt emphasize on Application Development, but shows the macros that can be used by programmers who are not familiar with Screen Control Language. The system includes a few macros that are compiled and stored in the SAS ® Catalog.   They can be used for any study without changes. Nevertheless the author shows you all tricks and techniques how to adapt these macros to your company needs and requirements. Using these techniques half of your report will be done in 5 minutes! OVERVIEW The MACRO %GLISTINGS is the major and the only macro that we have to call to generate a report for a specified SAS data set as shown in the examples #1-3.   The other macros are compiled and stored in SAS Catalog and they dont require any changes from study to study. If report has to be generated for all or",p106-24.pdf
"mitant medications it is often necessary to categorize data by preferred term. How this categorization occurs is a commonly misunderstood process. There are several different ways to summarize concomitant medication data: Preferred term, ATC Text, Indication by Preferred term, and various other combinations. Regardless of how the data is to be tabulated, it is essential to understand how your data is recorded and classified before starting to program statistical tables and data listings. INTRODUCTION: Concomitant medications can be recorded in many different ways ranging from trade (brand) name to nonproprietary names. Due to the variability in how medications are recorded, a standard naming convention is required in order to tabulate this data effectively.   A common method of standardization is to categorize medications by their Preferred Term. In order to do this, medications must be coded using the World Health Organization Drug Dictionary (WHODRUG). It is important to understand how to programmatically assign the preferred term using the drug dictionary in order to verify that coded medications are recorded consistently both within and across studies. In addition to categorizing concomitant medications by preferred term, an ATC code (Anatomical-TherapeuticChemical classification) is used for the coding of therapeutic uses of drugs. This paper will describe the WHODRUG dictionary, its contents, and how to programmatically assign the preferred term, followed by a brief de",p108-24.pdf
"Computing daily consumptions in medication compliance studies has been an arduous task. Pharmacy dispensing information systems typically report a days supply data field. However, the information contained in it is unpredictable, at best. A more reliable method of computing daily consumptions is interpretation of the sig field on the prescription label. However, the data entered in it is commonly a combination of pre-determined abbreviations, custom abbreviations and free text entries which often times include misspelled words.",p109-24.pdf
"This paper describes a SAS/AF application to extract large volumes of data in parallel from a multiple-terabyte RDBMS and directly populate a parallel SAS ® data mart. During population, the application allows the user to perform CPUintensive data transformation/normalization operations in parallel. This application also allows models generated by Enterprise Miner  software to be deployed in parallel to score the entire data mart, or subsets of it. Parallel execution is achieved using Torrent Systems' Orchestrate  application development and runtime environment, which allows the application to  extract data in parallel from a parallel RDBMS  load the results of SAS programs back into the database in parallel  process parallel data streams with parallel instances of a SAS DATA or PROC step for much higher throughput  store large data sets in parallel, providing faster access and eliminating storage restrictions  stream data between SAS steps without having to write intermediate results to disk. The performance benefits of executing SAS extracts and other processes in parallel are well documented. In both production and test environments, parallel processing has allowed SAS applications to process larger workloads more quickly typically improving performance by a factor equal to the number of processors used. These applications typically show near linear scalability. (An example of linear scalability is where a12-processor system provides 12 times the performance of a single processor.) These results are documented in the IBM Whitepaper, Achieving Scalable Performance for Large SAS Applications and Database Extracts. i",p11-24.pdf
"warehousing. While many papers discuss the concepts and reasons for data warehousing - here the author will describe methods to build a data warehouse. A data warehouse must be well organized, easy to understand, easy to use, and easy to reach. It will likely draw data from many sources, perhaps for multiple company segments, for multiple time periods, and varying degrees of detail. Should the developer create multiple SAS System® data libraries, or keep all the SAS data sets in a common library? Should the developer use a naming convention for SAS data libraries and data sets? What about documenting the data warehouse? Are indexes a good thing? Can indexes be overdone? Subsets and summarized SAS data sets? All these questions and more will be answered in the pages to follow as the author describes learns how to construct a data warehouse. I NTRODUCTION When we set out to construct our data warehouse, we have already decided that it is a good thing to do and it has its merits. We already have an idea what we are going to put in it, that is, what it will house. However, we may not yet know what it will look like, where we will erect it, or what we will use as building materials. Now is the time to become a data warehouse architect and make plans to build our data warehouse. Let us start with a model of our enterprise. OUR MODEL Our goal is to build a data warehouse that serves data for pre-made (automated) user applications and provides data for users to create ad hoc queries",p110-24.pdf

"Health care claims data are complicated animals. The eccentricities of this data include differences in the types of claims files and the services which populate those files, variations in the type of providers who service the population and the information needed about each type of provider, and finally, the actual populations of health care recipients and all of their individual specifications. Being able to sort through all of this data (and there is usually a lot of it!) and answers queries from insurers, providers, analysts, etc., and other people within your organization can be a real challenge. In the past, the solution was to have people submit requests for one or more programmers to extract data and run analyses. The problem was twofold: programmers were overwhelmed with requests, and worse, the data and/or analyses requested were not the correct solution to the problem. This paper will highlight how this challenge was met through the development of a Data Mart. This includes the steps taken in the design of the Mart, its base tables and MDDBs (MultiDimensional DataBase), the definition of SAS/EIS ® objects that can exploit MDDBs, and other specific customizations that were developed to allow one organization, the UMBC Center for Health Program Development and Management (CHPDM), to address these data access issues.",p113-24.pdf

"The IBM Storage Systems Division operates advanced manufacturing facilities for fabricating, assembling and testing all of the major components of IBM data storage products, from disks and magneto-resistive heads through finished disk drives and storage subsystems. The operational data from our manufacturing sites are also used for engineering analysis, yield management and problem diagnosis, within each factory and across factories throughout the division. This crossfunctional data allows us to exploit the benefit of vertical integration by analyzing the relationships between hard drive performance and component measurements, and using the resulting insight to eliminate yield detractors and optimize the performance and quality of the finished product. However, the data association task is very time- consuming because the operational data are located in several different databases, and the logical relationships among databases is quite complex. The JED (Just Enough Database) project was undertaken to optimize our use of operational data for yield analysis. The JED system consists of a Data Warehouse which combines and correlates data from several operational databases, and a graphical user interface, which automates the yield analysis process by providing engineers with preprogrammed failure mapping and yield sensitivity curves and drilldown access to source data for in-depth interactive analysis. The user interface was written in SAS/AF®, to run on the SAS system for PCs, using SAS/CONNECT® to extract data and code from the RS/6000® server.

"Paper 118 Data Warehousing on a Shoestring Rick Nicola, SPS Software Services Inc., Canton, OH Abstract: Perhaps the largest stumbling block in developing a data warehouse using SAS (or any other) products is cost justification. In many cases, the difficulty in gaining acceptance is not because of manpower expense, but in obtaining a longterm commitment to absorb the cost of additional software. In many companies, basic SAS products are available to mainframe users. This seemingly free software offers an opportunity to create a workable data warehouse as a proof of concept without substantial software investment. In some cases it is possible, given some fairly low level SAS tools, to create a very usable, functional data warehouse. Note that a data warehouse created with these limited tools and platforms will have limited, specific functionality. However, the existence and success of this can be very helpful in cost justifying future projects and additional software. This paper is a discussion of some of the techniques used to create a mainframe based data warehouse using a minimal SAS software configuration. This system contains many of the classical characteristics of a data warehouse and the flexibility to be extended to include other capabilities as supporting software products become available. The Project: This project is based on work done for an Ohio based insurance company. Our consulting group, SPS Software Services Inc., worked with company analysts to devise a system that would meet the information needs of the Special Lines area of the business. Prior to this activity, the insurance company had created a DB2 based Data Warehouse for the automobile portion of the business. Reporting against this DB2 repository was accomplished with SPF screens, SAS and GQL. Since auto represents such a large part of their business, their reporting needs were more complex and their investment justification was much larger. Because the Special Lines area repres",p118-24.pdf
"In 1996, a major data warehousing project was undertaken by the Information Resource Centre, Queensland Police Service. The objective of this project was to implement an infrastructure for the provision of crime related information and official Queensland Police Service statistics. This was achieved in 1997, however, access to key information was restricted to a number of specialists due to the type of skills required to interrogate the data warehouse. Senior executives received information on crime trends and summary statistics through a bimonthly publication. There was no provision of information to operational police throughout the state. In late 1997, the Information Resource Centre undertook a strategy to enhance access to the critical information now contained within the data warehouse. A key issue was how to deliver this information to over 8000 Queensland Police Service employees throughout the state of Queensland in an efficient and timely method to support the decision making process. The rapid development and delivery of information was key to the success of the decision support services strategy. Web technology and SAS IntrNet have been utilised to develop a suite of decision support services that allow statewide access to the data warehouse. This paper will explore the use of web technology, the development of decision support services within Queensland Police Service and related impacts and issues. 1",p119-24.pdf

"During the last decade, the deployment of Information Technology (IT) has been rapidly evolving from a necessary evil to a legitimate business strategy. In the early to mid 1990s Business Process Reengineering (BPR) was the hot business tool that allowed IT deployment to generate a positive return on investment (ROI) and obtain business objectives. The late 1990s have brought us another hot strategic business tool, Customer Relationship Management (CRM), which generates rapid ROI and long term profit growth. The business emphasis is on understanding your customer and building loyalty. The IT emphasis is on capturing all customer related data and turning it into decision ready information. Database marketing has evolved from mass to direct/target marketing over the last 3 decades, now emphasizing loyalty and individuality. This paper takes you through an evolution of strategic business tools, marketing as a discipline and information technology as they pertain to CRM. After a discussion of what is CRM, why it is so hot, and the benefits, this paper then discusses SAS Institutes approach and methods used to identify and obtain the valuable benefits of a CRM culture.

"Paper 123 Administering OLAP with SAS/Warehouse Administrator(TM) By Michael Burns, SAS Institute Inc., Austin, TX. Abstract: When building an OLAP application, there are a wide variety of strategies that can be used ranging from a simple summary table, or an MDDB with many crossings, to a HOLAP proxy with several associated MDDBs and summary tables. The process of building such a solution and getting it registered in a SAS/EIS(R) metabase can be quite complex. Changing your strategy can be a lot of work. Now, there is an OLAP Wizard [1] available as an add-in tool for SAS/Warehouse Administrator 1.3 [2] that greatly simplifies the process as well as allows you to change strategies. It builds and maintains an OLAP data group for you, and the associated code generator writes all of the PROC MDDB or PROC SUMMARY code to build the datastores. Finally, an associated metadata exporter registers it all for you in an SAS/EIS metabase. Background Understanding This paper assumes that you have some understanding of the SAS/Warehouse Administrator product and OLAP concepts in general, as well as the spiral diagram methodology. For more information on that methodology, refer to SAS/EIS Technical Report: HOLAP Extension, Release 6.12 [3] which is SAS publication 56564. Chapter 4 ( Implementation Strategies) explains the spiral methodology. SAS HOLAP extensions are available now in conjunction with SAS Consulting Services. For more information, contact your local SAS software representative. For an understanding of the OLAP Wizard consult its user documentation at OLAP Wizard User Documentation [4]. Input Data The sample input data used in this demonstration is the Toy Sales Database built for a Data Warehouse training session.

There are also dimensions involving distribution mechanisms, geography, and promotional campaigns. The design for",p123-24.pdf
"Whats All This Metadata Good For, Anyway? Using Metadata to Dynamically Generate SQL Jonathan Stokes, JJT Inc., Austin, Texas Metadata is becoming increasingly popular for data warehouse administration, but typically reporting and analysis applications utilize the same metadata in very limited ways. This paper discusses the metadata model and methods designed by JJT Inc. to create an extraction engine , using object-oriented SAS/AF ® software, that dynamically generates very efficient SQL code. Such an engine provides enterprise-wide performance enhancements by ensuring that all database extractions are optimized, a particularly important feature when using remote database systems. This paper gives an overview will be given of the programmatic interface to this metabase engine , including its effect on a typical end-user interface. It also explains how the SQL procedures pass-through facility, available with base SAS ® software and SAS/ACCESS ® products, boosts the efficiency of metadata-driven operations on remote databases. The information in this paper can benefit anyone interested in innovations in data warehousing and data analysis. The concept of dynamic, pass-through extract generation greatly increases the potential of stored metadata, and changes the role of the metabase in data warehousing. What Is Metadata? Metadata, or data about data , describes the contents of a database. Administrators can use this information for data management purposes; end-users and end-user applications can use it for locating and identifying information needed for decision support analysis. Typically, metadata is used in the form of documentation. Charts display table ownership, column data types, and relationships between columns for reference purposes. However, stored metadata has thus far been under-utilized by most applications. Optimal use of metadata is achieved when applications are metadata-driven.   In this approach, data-driven applications can rely on a metabase to",p124-24.pdf
"MDDB Suppost in Scalable Performance Data Server{ 2.5 Advanced Server Development SAS Institute Inc Cary, N C 27513 On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) allows individuals to gain insights to large amounts of data through fast analysis techniques that are supported by organizing the data into dimensions of the enterprise that are understood by the user. micallyr OLAP is performed on very large volumes of data maintained in a data warehouse or datamart. Standard database methods to guery/analyize the enterprise are not efficient due to the magnitude of the data resulting in an unacceptable time to respond to the request. A key requirement of a successful OLAP solution is to minimize the time of the query and analysis of the data to provide realtime results to the user. This can be accomplished by building a smaller multi-dimensional database (MDD3) from the enterprise data that is specifically organized to support the OLAP requirements of the user. A dimension contains attributes of a hierarchical nature representing a similar concept in the usex's view of the data. For example a time dimension could consist of year, month, and day attributes while a geography dimension could consist of continent, country, region, and state attributes. Associated with the dimensions are measures that axe of interest to the user. For example a measure could be sales. Associated with a measure are calculations such as sum, min, max, standard deviation, etc. An MDDB is used to pre-calculate and store the measure calculations across dimensions, organized in such a way as to support OLAP. In the above example the EDDB would maintain the calculation of sales across the time and geography dimension. The hierarchical structure of a dimension allows for drilling up or down the levels of the dimension to get the more general aggxegates (up) or more specific aggregates (down) of the calculations across the hierarchies. For example one could display the sum of sales for North America in 1994, th",p125-24.pdf

"r, Kelly M. McMasters; Department of Surgery; University of Louisville; Louisville, Kentucky 40292 ABSTRACT Quality-of-Life is a very subjective issue. This study investigates data routinely collected in the Sunbelt Melanoma Trial, a controlled, randomized clinical trial accruing a total of 1370 patients studied longitudinally for a minimal period of 7 years. The data mining procedures of Enterprise Miner will be used to examine the quality-of-life issues. INTRODUCTION Quality-of-life in medical care is extremely subjective. Not only does it vary from person to person, but it can vary from one stage in medical treatment to another in the same individual. Therefore, it is important to investigate the meaning of quality-of-life data through the data mining process as provided in Enterprise Miner. Philosophically, there has been a shift in health care. Increasingly, therapy is designed to improve a patient's quality-of-life, and not just to prolong life. Managed care is shifting from aggressive treatment of individual patients to defining social norms beyond which an individual treatment plan cannot go. The use of quality-of-life criteria is commonly seen in the definition of medication formularies; it is seen most prominently in the rationing of care in Oregon's Medicaid program which defines a list of 500+ diagnoses which will be treated; all other illnesses cannot be reimbursed for treatment. The list of 500+ was defined based upon cost effectiveness and quality-of-life analy",p128-24.pdf

"Paper 131 Automating the Management of a Data Warehouse Sy Truong, Meta-Xceed, Inc., Fremont, CA Kathy Boussina, Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA Overview Clinical trial reports and clinical data warehousing have traditionally been two different streams that merge at the final reporting stage. The function of generating the final clinical trial report and the delivery of a clinical data warehouse is often carried out by different departments. The transfer of information is frequently paper-driven and less than seamless. As the FDA guidelines evolve to meet the upcoming goals for paperless submissions and as the technology emerges, it becomes increasingly critical to improve areas of streamlining and automation. Genentech recently launched the electronic reporting pilot project to streamline the process to meet the FDA electronic reporting requirements. The goal of this project was to link clinical trial reports to SAS output and to data, thereby integrating publishing into the workflow. Hence, the need to publish SAS output and data is no longer occurring at the end of the process. To integrate output, data and documents from the outset and throughout the report development process, an application, known as e-DOC , was created for the pilot project. e-DOC facilitates broad and early access to information. It automates the management of the data warehouse by identifying dependencies; graphically representing the relationship of the SAS output to the data warehouse and the data warehouse to source data. It also provides for the ability to view detailed metadata (information about the data). The information is encapsulated and provided in a hyperlinked table of contents that fits neatly into the final clinical trial report. Electronic Submission Several components to a final clinical trial report constitute the complete deliverable. These include: the report text, the in-text tables, the report appendices (SAS output such as summary tables, by-patient listings",p131-24.pdf
"nformation and Statistics, US EPA Michael Yu, Digital Intelligence Systems Kamau Njuguna and Myles Powers, Northrop Grumman Corporation Abstract The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Center for Environmental Information and Statistics (CEIS) has developed and administers EPAs SAS Analytic Library using SAS/Share Servers, SAS/Data Warehouse Administrator, SAS/EIS, SAS/MDDB Server, and SAS/IntrNet. This paper describes the strategy, architecture, and sample products of Library. We show how SAS analysts worldwide with SAS/Connect and TCP/IP can access the Library, obtain metadata about each data system and table in the Library, and produce environmental statistics, graphics, and maps. From CEIS's website and SAS/Share Server, SAS users at all skill levels on all operating systems can analyze environmental data for the whole nation or individual states, counties, ZIP codes, and communities. As far as we know, no other SAS/Share Server in the world provides as much environmental data in SAS format for analysis purposes. CEISs Strategy Figure 1 illustrates the audiences for data products from EPAs SAS Analytic Library. In essence, the Library publishes EPAs data via the Internet, to be used by SAS programmers in the environmental community worldwide. CEIS chose to denormalize data to simplify analysis. Normalized data structures store each data point exactly once at its appropriate level, except for variables to link various data levels. Denormalized data structures me",p132-24.pdf
"The Decennial Census is the largest undertaking of the U.S. government, excluding war. The Management Information System (MIS) used to manage the 2000 Decennial Census operations is a complex, top to bottom SAS data warehouse. The warehouse data is stored on a UNIX server in a series of SAS data structures and is expected to grow to approximately 1TB in size by 2003. This paper will answer the questions: why was SAS chosen as the preferred data repository, not a traditional database product?

"Paper 135 Unlocking SAP AG R/3 data with the SAS System!!! The SAS® Intelligent Warehousing Solution for R/3 SAS Institute Inc. SUGI 1999 Introduction Thousands of Organizations have made the strategic decision to replace existing production application with package solutions designed to re-engineer their existing business processes. Actually these applications are designed to do much more, including things like replacing outdated applications with ones that are Year 2000 compliant, cross business process integration, and more. Integrating business processes allows organizations to streamline activities that span across operational functions. Since these applications typically affect many aspects of the enterprise they are commonly referred to as Enterprise Resource Planning or ERP Solutions. The market leader in the ERP Industry is clearly SAP AGs R/3 System, with approximately 40% of the market share. SAP AG, as with other ERP Vendors, such as JD Edwards, Baan, and PeopleSoft, offer increased efficiency in the day-to-day management of their production or operational infrastructure by providing integrated modules covering various functional areas. Such modules may include (but are not limited to) finance, sales and distribution, human resources, materials management and more.   One benefit of these integrated solutions is that everything is linked together, so that if a customer places an order the company issues the required invoice. The invoice is not just registered in the financial module, but any other relevant area, like logistics, materials management, and others are updated appropriately. The decisions to implement these solutions have proven to be successful in areas of integrating business processes for automated and optimal production system management bringing improved operational efficiency, better productivity and increased profitability. The ability to enter a simple transaction and automatically propagate downstream functions to occur without manua",p135-24.pdf

"To accommodate the conversion from the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), the U.S. Census Bureau implemented a warehousing solution. Known as the NAICS Database System, it became pivotal to the 1997 Economic Census. It provided corporate data, access, and analytical tools   using SAS® products  primarily SAS data sets, SAS/EIS® software, SAS/MDDB software, SAS/AF® software, and SAS programming language. As a warehousing project, the NAICS Database System consolidates information from legacy systems across the economic area at the Census Bureau for data analysis and production of composite publications. Unlike other data warehousing projects, it differs in three respects. First, it is integrated into production systems for the Economic Census, and refreshed weekly. Second, its use is tied to actual deliverables in the publication release of first-time economy-wide Core Statistics Reports. Given these deliverables, third, the system is   used not merely by researchers mining data for new opportunities, but rather by production analysts who have the job of reviewing and releasing data for publication. Approximately 200 analysts use the system.

"A successful Data Warehouse Design for a Major UK Distribution Company resulted in the development of a Data Warehouse using the SAS System. The Data Warehouse is located on an MVS mainframe running SAS ® Release 6.09 and this is used as a server to the Windows 95 clients. The Warehouse holds summarised SAS files created from over 200GB of IMSDL/1 data. This data is then accessed through a Client-Server structure by SAS/EIS objects within a Graphical User Interface running SAS Release 6.12. The use of the HOLAP Add-Ins to SAS/EIS Software allowed the SAS/MDDB Server to provide extremely fast data access times. For a summarised SAS file of 1.5 million observations, the longest drill time was under 5 seconds and in many cases much shorter. This paper documents this Data Warehouse and its associated EIS and OLAP aspects.",p138-24.pdf
"information across business dimensions, it can also create very large databases. With the introduction of the HOLAP solution users can now design databases using multi-dimensional databases, SAS datasets, and relational data stores. This offers a lot of flexibility, but how are these databases designed to make the best use of each technology? INTRODUCTION This paper will explore how the HOLAP solution can be used to build large, remote databases that are specifically designed for navigation of data. It will explore how and when to use each type of technology so that the final outcome will be the best it can be. Finally, it will give some basic examples of building these multidimensional databases. WHAT IS HOLAP? To really answer this question, one must first understand what OLAP is. OLAP (OnLine Analytical Processing) applications are meant to allow users the freedom to interrogate their data. OLAP basically allows users to compare similar data points at any level of category. Basically, OLAP is supposed to offer fast access to data along any business dimension. To allow this, technology companies took two distinctly different paths. Some introduced new databases built specifically for multi-dimensional queries, while others offered very sophisticated SQL and navigational methods on top of traditional RDBMS databases. As is often the case with technology companies they decided to use this different data store as a competitive difference in the marketplace. This competition cr",p139-24.pdf
"The Data Set Entry classes display the contents of SAS data sets as follows: Data Form displays one row of a SAS data set at a time using SAS/AF widgets to represent the columns. Data Table provides a tabular display of multiple rows of a SAS data set. This paper will illustrate a technique of combining the best of both, Data Table and Data Form, to build a Data Entry and Correction System. This system will have a Data Table widget displayed on the top half of a frame and a Data Form widget on the bottom half. When a row within the Data Table is clicked, the same record is displayed on the Data Form where data may be entered and/or modified. Buttons on a toolbar allow the users to perform various functions: FORWARD, BACKWARD, TOP, BOTTOM, ADD, DELETE, UPDATE, SORT, FIND, HIDE/UNHIDE, END, RESET. For example, when the FORWARD button is clicked, the next record in the SAS data set is shown on the top row of the Data Table, which is synchronized with the same record shown on the Data Form, where data can be edited.

"lways kept meta-data, or data about their data. But it was not until the introduction of a 'common meta-data model' that these products have actually been able to share their meta-data. SAS/EIS ® software, SAS/MDDB  software, SAS/Warehouse Administrator  software and others have or are adding support for a common meta-data model. Some examples of the closer integration of these products through their common meta-data layer are discussed. For example, the ability to seamlessly create metadata in one product and exploit it in another product is presented. INTRODUCTION Most SAS software products define and manipulate meta-data of some sort. In the past, this meta-data was the exclusive property of that application. However, the integrated meta-data strategy now being adopted at SAS Institute, using a common meta-data model, will enable these formerly disjoint applications to interoperate and add value to each other. A META-DATA OVERVIEW First of all, it is important to have a common understanding of what meta-data actually is. The most common definition is data about data. An important example of this is a database table: What is its name? What type of information does it contain? How many columns does the table have? What are the names of the columns? the data types? A data warehouse administration tool, such as the SAS/Warehouse Administrator software describes not only the physical structure of the data, but also the mappings, transformations and processes needed to t",p140-24.pdf
"Two key application design principles are evident in modern systems. First, server functionality should be decoupled from presentation functionality, allowing common back-end applications to be exploited across a diverse set of customized user interfaces. Second, enterprise-class solutions often entail the integration of several disparate vendor applications, such that application interoperability and flexibility of deployment are required. Several middleware technology standards have emerged as enablers of these principles. Component-based distributed object platforms expressed by the Object Management Groups CORBA/IIOP and Microsofts COM address these considerations within an objectoriented programming model. Similarly, message-queuing platforms expressed by IBMs MQSeries and Microsofts MSMQ address these considerations within a message-passing programming model. Access to and presentation from the SAS Systems business intelligence, data warehousing, and decision support facilities has been extended by these middleware environments. Deployment in thin client, Web, and n-tier embedded application configurations is now possible, as is development in an expanded set of programming languages including C++, Java, and Visual Basic. These new integration technologies deliver the enabling infrastructure supporting the next generation of solutions from SAS Institute and delivers that same infrastructure to an enterprises solution integrators. An overview of SAS Institute's positioning of these technologies will be presented.",p141-24.pdf
", Cary NC ABSTRACT Enterprise quality improvement is quite different from quality improvement at the process level. Enterprise quality improvement requires information from many departments within an organization, such as production, quality assurance, engineering, customer service, and purchasing. Typically, these groups collect large amounts of data from disparate and disconnected systems. The systems include a variety of Statistical Process Control (SPC) systems implemented on different production lines at different plants, as well as data collected in Laboratory Information Management Systems (LIMS), Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES), Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP), and Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP) systems.   The disparity and disconnection of these systems poses a major problem for the implementation of enterprise quality improvement. Data warehousing is a technology that is designed to facilitate analytical processing on data from disparate sources. This technology is being employed successfully today in many industries such as finance and retail where it aids, for example, in the understanding of customers and their buying habits. Now, forward thinking companies in the manufacturing industry are beginning to use data warehousing to address enterprise level quality. Transactional systems exist to do the job of gathering and storing the detail data, whereas the data warehouse exists to serve the decision-making needs of the enterprise.

INTRODUCTION SAS/ASSIST software is a user-friendly front-end to the SAS System. Its A push-button @ menus provide options for many of the tasks you would want to perform. Selections are made and acted upon without the user having to write any SAS code. Programs can be saved that will be run repetitively. The SAS/ASSIST interface can be customized to better suit the needs of the user and the environment of the work to be accomplished. ASSIST is designed to be self-explanatory; however, some hands-on experience can be a helpful training aid for the novice user. SAS/ASSIST can be invoked by typing assist on the command line or by selecting Solutions and ASSIST from the pull-down or pop-up menus (or from the SAS Environment window). We will start with the Block Menu Startup Mode. The default Primary Menu will appear. SETUP Beginning with Release 6.12 of the SAS System, SAS/ASSIST no longer automatically creates sample data sets when you invoke it. To have these available requires a one-time step. Click on the SETUP button on the Main Menu. Next choose Sample tablesunder File management: and Create sample tables  Click on the box to the left of each of the data sets to select them all, then click on the OK button. After the sample data sets are created click on GOBACK three times to return to the Primary Menu. DATA MANAGEMENT One of the first things you might want to do in the SAS System is browse or edit a set of data. Click on the DATA MGMT button in ASSIST. A wide range of tasks can be specified from the following menu, including doing SQL queries on the data, importing data from other formats, creating subsets, and so on.

"how to use PROC PRINT. Its primary use may be as a development tool to help in debugging a long multi-step program, or as a simple report generator when all that is really needed is a quick look at the data, or even a basic low-level finished report. However, if a report generation/information delivery tool with powerful formatting, summarizing and analysis features is called for, then PROC REPORT is the solution. PROC REPORT can provide the standard PROC PRINT functionality, but in addition, can easily perform many of the tasks that you would otherwise have to use the SORT, MEANS, FREQ and TABULATE procedures to accomplish. PROC REPORT is part of the Base SAS product, can run in both an interactive screen-painting mode or a batch mode, and should be the basic tool of choice when there is a need to produce powerful and productive reports from SAS data sets. This paper will present the basics of PROC REPORT (non-interactive mode) through a series of progressively more sophisticated examples of code and output. The main thrust behind PROC REPORT has been its interactive WYSIWYG ability, in which reports are designed online via screen painting manipulation of actual output. When the desired result is achieved, the design and structure of the report can be saved as a catalog entry and called up repeatedly for additional runs with new sets of data. The design can then be modified at any time, and can either be replaced or saved as an additional entry. This is all done in a Displa",p146-24.pdf
"BSTRACT PROC REPORT will display data. Thats a given. That it is more powerful than the standard SAS ® reporting tool PROC PRINT is also becoming common knowledge. But what can PROC REPORT really do? It is certainly more than a glorified PROC PRINT, but it does take some additional work beyond mastering some of the basics of the procedure before it can be used to produce output that can rival that of a serious DATA _NULL_ step. This paper will discuss the use of several customized macros which can work together with some PROC REPORT options, and standard SAS title and footnote statements, to make your PROC REPORT output really shine. The purpose of this paper is to provide some methods, through a progressive series of examples, to enhance the output created when using PROC REPORT. It is assumed that you know how to write a basic PROC REPORT program including COLUMN, DEFINE, COMPUTE, and BREAK portions of the syntax. It is also assumed you have some understanding of what a basic SAS MACRO can do and that parameters can be passed to the macros.

"a university environment in 1972, I was very excited about how much SAS could help me. As I learned more and more and moved to the real world of the employeed I needed more flexibility in my reporting - PROC PRINT had some and PROC MEANS and FREQ had basically none. And SUMMARY needed too much DATA step manipulation. What I needed was a marriage of all these with the flexibility to control what I wanted where and how! Thank the Gods for PROC TABULATE!! I was able to produce reports from massive amounts of data in practically any way I needed! The power of being able to simply rearrange a few variable names and change the complete look of the report was great. But then I also found a few things that were not so simple-like percentages. BEFORE TABULATE So many times when you first learn some new software product, you simply do what you are told or can findout about it. I learned base SAS software the same way at a university from a friend. It was for some math classes and I learned to do some simple inputting and frequency tables and summaries using PROC FREQ and SUMMARY. It wasn't until years later I discovered the power of PROC TABULATE. If all you ever need to do is some simple cross-tabulations or simply print a list of summaries, PROC FREQ or MEANS or SUMMARY will do the job.

"nes the functionality of the DATA and PROC Steps into a single procedure. PROC SQL in many cases can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. PROC SQL can be used to retrieve, update, and report on information from SAS data sets or other database products. This paper will concentrate on SQL's syntax and how to access information from existing SAS data sets. Some of the topics covered include: Write SQL code using various styles of the SELECT statement. Dynamically create new variables on the SELECT statement. Use SQL options to control the appearance of reports. Create multiple reports with a single PROC SQL statement. Create reports containing percentages using PROC SQL. Use CASE/WHEN clauses for conditionally processing the data. Joining data from two or more data sets (like a MERGE!). Why Learn PROC SQL? PROC SQL can not only retrieve information without having to learn SAS syntax, but it can often do this with fewer and shorter statements than traditional SAS code. Additionally, on average it uses fewer resources than conventional DATA and PROC steps. This means PROC SQL can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. Further, the knowledge learned is transferrable to other SQL packages. An Example of PROC SQL's Syntax Every PROC SQL must have at least one SELECT statement. The purpose of the SELECT statement is to name the columns that will appear on the report and the order in which they will appear (similar to a VAR statement on PROC PRINT)",p157-24.pdf

Part 2 shows how to override the defaults of the TSFS and take control of specifying a model. Part 3 shows how to add explanatory variables to the forecasting model and control the period of evaluation and fit of a model. This paper is written using the SAS ® System Version 6.12. PART 1: USING THE TSFS IN AUTOMATIC MODE The first step is to make sure a libname statement has been executed to point to the directory containing the SAS data set to be analyzed. In the workshop, you will use SAS data sets found in the SASHELP directory. The TSFS can be accessed either through menu choices (see Figure 1) as Globals b Analyze b   Forecasting or by entering the command forecast on the command line or by assigning the command forecast to a function key.

"e Internet, the demand for distributed computing is on the increase. With the Nashville Vision, the user can use SAS software to create distributed SAS/AF objects to exploit the data and compute power of the SAS System. In this paper, we will discuss the use of SAS/AF applications on the client accessing remote models on the SAS server. Users familiar with SAS/AF software can write distributed applications without getting a higher degree. INTRODUCTION Distributed applications have become more mainstream. In particular, invoking methods on remote objects has become very popular because of technologies like COM/DCOM and Java. These distributed applications allow state-of-the-art user interfaces created with any of several application development tools to be bound to legacy systems with minimal effort. They also allow thin and/or smart clients to use large server based databases and to use the computing power of large servers. It is now possible to create SAS/AF objects using the SAS Component Language (SCL) that can be accessed remotely by various clients using numerous transport mechanisms. Those objects can be used locally within a SAS session or they can be used remotely from client applications that could be written in languages like C++, VB, Java and SCL. Likewise, SAS/AF applications can be built to create instances of and invoke methods on local objects or remote objects. These remote objects can be accessed via COM/DCOM or a special protocol implemented on top of TCP/IP",p16-24.pdf
"Data mining has captured the hearts and minds of business analysts seeking a solution for exploring and modeling vastly larger, more complex and less well-behaved datasets. Exploratory data analysis, typically consisting of activities like statistical visualization, hypothesis generation, and introductory model fitting is a vital first step in any successful data mining venture. Exploratory data analysis produces direct benefits for data miners in enhanced understanding of data, improved clarity and confidence of the modeling results, and avoidance of pitfalls early in the process. SAS/INSIGHT is SAS Institutes leading software for facilitating exploratory data analysis featuring a uniquely visual analytic toolset. This paper will review the usefulness of SAS/INSIGHT software for exploratory data analysis, interactive regression modeling, and advanced multidimensional data visualization.

"Paper 161 Robust Outlier Identification using SAS ® Jack Shoemaker, North Haven, CT Raw data from transaction systems contain all manner of noise and pollution which can confound analysis and reporting unless identified and removed. This paper, originally present at BASUG, presents an applied statistical technique to identify outliers in raw data using tools available in Base SAS. Comparing Data Using Measures of Location A common task for a data analyst is comparing two or more sets of data to each other, or to an established reference value. For example, imagine an automated software product that will execute a simple Oracle transaction as if it were an Oracle user sitting at a terminal. The product records the time it takes for the system to respond to the transaction, thus measuring the response time faced by a typical user. This process is repeated twelve times a day, five times a week, for four weeks. At the end of this four week period, we have a sample of 240 (=12 x 5 x 4) observations of response time for each transaction executed at a client site. Part of the service we provide to our clients is comparing their response times to the response times of other clients in our data base. To carry out this type of comparison, it is helpful to reduce the sample of data for each client to a single value representing the whole sample, and then compare these values across clients. The formal name for this class of reference values is measure of location. The mean, mode, and median of a data distribution are all examples of measures of location of those data. For a variety of reasons, both technical and historical, we use the mean as the preferred measure of location when comparing data distributions across samples. The Problem of Extreme Values Unfortunately, the mean is the least robust of the three measures of location listed above. That is, the mean is influenced by data points lying farthest away from itself. To make matters worse, the farther away these extremes",p161-24.pdf
"Using SAS/GRAPH Software to Detect Fraud in the Utah Medicaid Program Terry Allen, Ph.D., Utah Bureau of Medicaid Fraud Salt Lake City, Utah INTRODUCTION The Utah Bureau of Medicaid Fraud is charged with policing fraud and abuse in a $670 million a year state Medicaid system. This system processes approximately 300,000 claims each month. In the past, the sheer volume of claims precluded effective analysis to detect specific fraudulent doctors and fraudulent methods. SAS/GRAPH software effectively presents masses of observations in a single visual, making it possible to detect fraudulent trends and to compare Medicaid providers with their peers. This paper examines univariate, bivariate and multivariate graphical methods to detect billing patterns that may indicated fraud. EXAMPLES FIGURE 1: [GSLIDE] Office- visit billing codes are determined by the amount of time the doctor spends with the patient. This figure shows the maximum charges allowed by Medicaid for each code. The services range from l'minimal"" service (99211) where a doctor might give a shot or take someone's blood pressure to l'comprehensivel' service (99215) where a doctor may spend 40 minutes or more with the Medicaid patient. Medicaid pays more as the level of service increases. Office visit fraud occurs in two ways, both involve doctors who bill for services that are were not provided. First, a doctor may bill Medicaid for an office visit that never occurred, and second, a doctor may provide a low-level service but bill Medicaid as though a higher level of service was provided. UNIVARIATE EXAMPLE FIGURE 2: [GCHARTI In this chart provider specialties are grouped so that doctors can be compared with a homogeneous group of their peers, i.e. an individual pediatrician with all pediatricians.

"20141 Milano, Italia. 2 Department of Statistics P. Fortunati, Università di Bologna, Via Belle Arti, 41, 40126 Bologna, Italia. Summary The aim of the work is to pinpoint a number of behavioural characteristics of the Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) retail customers by using several analytical tools. A panel sample is maintained which is observed each semester. A factor analysis and a cluster analysis are carried out in order to subdivide customers into segments according to the main factors affecting their behaviour. Repeating the same clustering procedure every semester, it is possible to carry out a migration analysis between segments. For this purpose, SAS/Insight is used to explore data through graphs and analyses linked across multiple windows. Moreover, the transitions from one cluster to another are studied following a model-based approach, but the present availability of only three waves makes our assumptions too simple to describe the customers migration process. Keywords: Multivariate data analysis, SAS/Insight, Mover-Stayer Model Information Visualization 1 Introduction. The object of this project is to test the use of several analytical tools in order to pinpoint a number of behavioural characteristics of the Banca Commerciale Italiana (BCI) retail customers.

"ervices, Horhsam, PA. ABSTRACT SAS/GRAPH® software affords ways to construct powerful data visualization tools for discovering, confirming, summarizing, and communicating patterns and relationships in a data set.   This paper demonstrates the use of dot charts with error bars and bubble charts as useful adjuncts to tabular reporting.   These graphical tools organize and present complex (even multidimensional) data that directly address important business decisions. INTRODUCTION In the credit card industry, many of our prospects are solicited via preapproved offers. These offers are extended based on a priori knowledge of creditworthiness and financial behavior derived from an analysis of data obtained from a credit bureau. However, some credit card issuers also buy prospect names through list brokers. Since there is little or no credit or financial behavior data on these prospects, they do not receive a preapproved offer. List brokers are an important source for prospect names that have demonstrated some interest or behavior which can be tied into a marketing campaign. For example, subscribers to selected travel magazines may receive card offers featuring the opportunity to accumulate frequent flier miles based on card usage.    Or, supporters of an environmental cause may have the opportunity to receive a credit card which will generate a donation to that cause based on card usage. Direct mail marketing campaigns typically include deliberate testing of random samples of",p164-24.pdf

Programmers, unfortunately, usually do not have visual design training so too often the result is a clumsy interface running powerful code. Luckily, there are straight-forward methodologies for GUI design that can be easily implemented.

"with knowledge of a few tools, can produce most types of graphs. SAS/GRAPH PROCedures provide canned methods for creating graphics; global statements control the general appearance of the graphics, and the ANNOTATE facility can customize, or even produce, most anything that the procedures can produce. This paper will lay the foundation of the functionality of global statements, heavily emphasize the capabilities of the ANNOTATE facility, and suggest additional resources to use when customizing graphics. Assumptions To use the annotate facility and the global statements, certain prerequisites must be met:  A working knowledge of basic SAS/GRAPH PROCedures.  A working knowledge of how SAS/GRAPH can be made to display or print graphics on your operating system.  A thorough understanding of the DATA step will be very important, since the ANNOTATE facility relies on the creation of a dataset to operate.  An understanding of SAS/BASE global statements (e.g. TITLE, FOOTNOTE, OPTIONS, etc.). Also, knowing that global statements execute immediately upon reaching those statements in the code is important. Global Statements Global statements, such as TITLE and FOOTNOTE, are used in SAS/BASE to enhance output. SAS/GRAPH offers a number of graphic-specific global statements, plus options on the TITLE and FOOTNOTE statements, to customize graphics procedures.

"g an ANNOTATE data set using assignment statements. To be used properly you need to understand how they work and what they will do for you. They will not abrogate your need to understand how the process of creating the data set works. Indeed you need to have a good understanding of how the ANNOTATE data set is constructed before you should attempt to use these macros. Keywords ANNOTATE, macro, annomac, SAS/GRAPH Introduction The process of creating observations in an ANNOTATE data set can be simplified through the use of ANNOTATE macros. Since macros are executed before the data step is compiled and executed, these macros can be used to generate the assignment statements that you would otherwise create yourself. These macros are predefined to give the user the ability to control all of the basic variables associated with given ANNOTATE function. When controlling a function the macro name usually takes on the name of the function that is to be defined. Using these macros can eliminate some of the tedium associated with the use of assignment statements. When using ANNOTATE macros it is important to remember that the macro call will be resolved into a series of DATA step assignment statements. These are the assignment statements that you could have written if you had chosen not to use the macro. There are two types of ANNOTATE macros those that prepare or manage the environment and those that define functions. Primarily you will want to use macros to replace the series of assign",p168-24.pdf

"The Solid Rocket Boosters of the Space Shuttle have very unique and critical requirements as airframe structures. They support the entire shuttle stack, absorb stresses of main engine start, experience water impact at greater than 60 miles per hour, and remain immersed in salt water for approximately 48 hours.   In addition, the maintenance and deployment of the hardware takes place in a seacoast environment. In order to maintain the integrity of the hardware, inspections are performed on the entire structure after each flight to locate corrosion for remediation and analysis. The data for these inspections has been kept graphically on paper and descriptively on standard spreadsheet software. This paper describes the development of an on-line analytical system that will be used to facilitate inspections through a graphical interface, store all the data in flexible format and allow the mining of the data for new information on the structure. Specifically, the software will be used to identify areas where the corrosion protection design is deficient, monitor the effect of changes to the corrosion protection system, and trend the damage accumulation for life prediction. This is the first phase of implementation of a data warehouse on the structures. Work is also in progress to allow the inclusion of maintenance history, problem reports, materials process and traceability data, and to support the structural analysis of the hardware. The ultimate driver of this effort is increased system reliability by the transformation of currently available data, using data mining techniques, into information, which can be used to make better resource management decisions.

The goal of our research was to gain insight into the possible relationships between inmates thinking styles and key criminal patterns. Using new, easy to use, graphical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, we were able to find many factors worth further investigation. In this paper, we show that, for this inmate population, there appear to be key links between criminal behavior and negative attitudes, choice of friends, and dysfunctional early childhood experiences. We hypothesize that these criminal attitudes/thought patterns, which also may possibly be linked to a number of key criminal rehabilitation factors, could be learned/changed in intimate social groups.

"SAS® SOFTWARE AND THE WORLD WIDE WEB: SIMPLIFIED Faith R. Sloan, Intranet Architect FRS Associates, LLC San Francisco, CA 94114-1987 Introduction Corporate use of the Internet has grown rapidly in the past few years. With that growth has come a demand for applications and databases that both internal and external intranet users can access easily and securely. It is now quite possible to develop a functional Web site, complete with database applications, on a desktop computer using the SAS System in a matter of hours or a few days -- and often with only a small financial investment. The World Wide Web allows you to not only access textual information but to also access pictures, sounds, or videos from across the world. Heres how you can leverage The SAS Software Internet tools to save time, labor, and material costs. This is the true meaning of Rapid Applications Development (RAD). Hypertext Markup Language(HTML) This section briefly introduces you to the art of creating web pages the old-fashioned way -by hand. There are many software ""tools"" that allow you create web pages without touching any HTML. You have to still correct these HTML editors assumptions so you still have to truly become familiar with HTML. Also, if you are serious about doing more than a simple page or two, and want to further your knowledge as well as your market value, a solid footing in the basics will greatly accelerate what you can do. Simply stated, HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a page layout language that tells a web browser how to display a web page. It doesnt even come close to being a programming language. Its rather simple for the most part. The documents themselves are plain text files with special ""tags"" or codes that a web browser knows how to interpret and display on your screen. Now that you know what HTML is, let's start using it. An HTML document contains two distinct parts: the head and the body. The head contains information about the document that is not displayed",p186-24.pdf
"xplosive growth of the internet has enabled data of just about any topic to be readily available to anyone at anytime. Integrating the information delivery capabilities of the internet with the excellent report functionality of SAS ® , provides a solid application platform for delivering information to support business decisions. In this paper, we introduce a report application - a basic frequency generator - that obtains user input to dynamically generate information. INTRODUCTION As an example of a dynamic web-enabled reporting application, this paper examines a frequency generation system. In this application, a user selects two variables which will be distributed across either states or census regions and compared to each other. The three main steps to generate dynamic web reporting are:  Obtaining user requirements.  Passing these requirements (parameters) to SAS.  Using SAS routines to gather these requirements and generate the report. OBTAINING USER REQUIREMENTS This first step involves producing an initial HTML page to gather the report parameters. Building the HTML page is fairly basic and you will find a number of excellent HTML reference manuals on the market. The HTML page consists of a form where, in this example, we gather the variables the user is interested in comparing and call the next program (see fig 1). Fig 1. Form to collect report parameters Using the information collected on the form, the application executes a cgi script. This cgi script is the int",p187-24.pdf
"Our clients Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) Public Voucher Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) billing process could not support all contracts due to limitations inherent in the enterprise accounts receivable process. Prior to the Web implementation, only those contracts not requiring detailed accounting information could be sent electronically. Since there is a substantial cycle time reduction in the payment process for electronic invoices, it was imperative that all invoices be sent electronically. We were asked to create a Web interface that would allow accounting information to be added to invoices after they had been generated by the legacy billing system. We chose SAS/IntrNet as our implementation tool because it runs on all our enterprise platforms and allowed us to wrap a Web front end around our existing SAS® software based electronic invoicing process.",p188-24.pdf
", Cary, NC ABSTRACT This paper highlights some ways of customizing SAS/GRAPH® device drivers to produce graphics that are suitable for presentation on the Web. It also highlights new Version 7 enhancements that allow you to create HTML image maps in order to produce drill-down graphs on the Web. INTRODUCTION You can use SAS/GRAPH software in three different ways to produce output on the Web: 1. SAS/GRAPH Device Drivers This method is designed for batch jobs. It creates HTML files for you and uses the GOPTIONS statement to direct procedure output to GIF files that are referenced in the HTML files. 2. Output Delivery System (ODS) This method also creates HTML files for you. The advantage of using this method over device drivers is that it lets you combine output from different procedures to define custom layouts. 3. Output Data Set of SAS/GRAPH This method is for users with extensive HTML knowledge who want to write their own Web pages that include SAS/GRAPH output with drill-down capabilities. With this method, you use the SAS language to generate your own HTML files. Thus, your HTML page design is not limited to designs the first two methods generate for you; you can design the Web pages any way you like. Using SAS/GRAPH Device Drivers You may prefer this method if you have experience with device drivers and GOPTIONS statements. SAS/GRAPH software provides three device drivers to create HTML output for the Web: GIF, HTML and WEBFRAME. The GIF driver creates a GIF format file",p189-24.pdf

"you can exploit Output Delivery System (ODS) styles to produce HyperText Markup Language (HTML) summary and detail reports ready for Web publishing. This paper shows how you can customize the stylistic appearance of your reports using extensions to PROC REPORT and PROC TABULATE that are specific to ODS. Introduction The BASE SAS REPORT and TABULATE procedures are mainstays of the SAS report writers toolkit. For Version 7, these procedures have been tightly integrated with ODS. You can manipulate ODS styles directly from the PROC REPORT and PROC TABULATE languages, thanks to new extensions. This paper will show you how to use these extensions to create eye-catching and informative reports, with emphasis given to these techniques:  Hyperlinking  for connecting reports to related resources.  Traffic lighting  for representing acceptance criteria for data.  Graphics  for producing snazzier reports. Styles Note: For a comprehensive treatment of ODS and styles see The Complete Guide to the SAS Output Delivery System. ODS styles govern the overall look and feel of Version 7 SAS procedure output. Styles determine the colors, fonts, graphic images, and other visual aspects in effect when output is generated. SAS delivers several predefined styles with Version 7, and you can customize them or create new ones. Exactly one style is in effect at any time during a SAS session. It applies to all procedure output during the period it is in effect. Such output has a uniform look and f",p190-24.pdf
"nterpoint Consulting Ltd, Wellington, New Zealand Colin Harris, Warehouse Solutions, Wellington, New Zealand ABSTRACT The New Zealand Department of Social Welfare (DSW) has a large, well-established and successful corporate data warehouse. This warehouse first went into production in 1996. It has been continually enhanced since that time, and now services more than one government department. The hardware has been upgraded, the data quantity and sources have increased, and more vital information is being provided from the data warehouse. Although the number of users has doubled to over fifty, until recently access was still limited to analysts with specialist SAS ® skills. This paper presents our experience of, and the lessons learnt from Web enabling a large and mature data warehouse: from determining the real need and benefits, to undertaking research and appropriate planning, through to implementation. The decision to Web enable the warehouse was motivated by two business needs. The first requirement was to provide analysts with improved metadata: centralising the information from a variety of locations and disseminating it to analysts in a timely and relevant manner. The second requirement was to provide direct access to management information from the warehouse to nonexpert users, particularly in a time of rapid political change. THE WAREHOUSE BACKGROUND The Department of Social Welfare data warehouse first came into production in January 1996. The department sees the dat",p191-24.pdf

"Intranet Security and SAS : A Brute Force Approach Kerril Bauerly, LabOne, Inc., Lenexa, KS Introduction As the largest insurance laboratory in the United States, we generate literally thousands of pages of reports each reporting period. These reporting periods range from daily to yearly. In order to cut down on some of the paper and to make data more easily accessible, we began work on a company Intranet. The initial idea was to give executives easy access to reports that might otherwise get lost on a cluttered desktop.   With that goal in mind, LabOne, LIVE! (Laboratory Information Visualization Environment) was born. This Intranet system uses the SAS broker and application dispatcher available with SAS/INTRNET software in addition to the SAS HTML formatting macros. Due to the sensitivity of our data, security is a big issue. This paper primarily covers the implementation of our internal security. The HTML code for our system resides on the network in the directory designated by our Network Administrator. The SAS code also resides on the network in close proximity to the broker. However, since all of our data resides on an Open-VMS Alpha box, we chose to leave it there. We use SAS/SHARE to access it on the Alpha. Login screen People with access to our Intranet may reach it by opening their browsers and calling up our login screen. Because we do not have any kind of encryption software available to us, we have had to invent our own security procedures and then implement them. Html The chunk of code displayed from LOGON.HTM creates an extremely basic HTML form which allows the user to enter their userid and password and then press enter or click on the submit button. I will note here, that I incorporated a very basic javascript subroutine to make sure both userid and password fields are filled in prior to submission of the form to the broker. Notice the METHOD=POST option on the FORM tag. The METHOD attribute of the <FORM> tag determines how the form's data is sent",p194-24.pdf
"Intranet Security and SAS : A Sneaky Approach to Dynamic Applications Kerril Bauerly, LabOne, Inc.,Lenexa, KS Introduction When we first started developing our LabOne, LIVE! Intranet, security was our biggest concern. As we became more familiar with the tools available to us through SAS/IntrNet, we developed new ways of making our system secure. Our login application is covered in another paper, but this paper covers what happens after a user has successfully logged into our Intranet. This Intranet system uses the SAS broker and application dispatcher available with SAS/IntrNet software in addition to the HTML formatting macros. Due to the sensitivity of our data, security is a big issue. We want to offer users an easy to use interface and still keep unauthorized users from viewing sensitive materials. It's important to note here that our datasets are stored on an Open_VMS Alpha box. These datasets can then be accessed from the broker through the SAS/SHARE server. In addition, these datasets are password protected for both read and write. We are regulating user access with 2 main datasets: our APPLication FUNCtion dataset and our DYNamic HTML dataset. APPLFUNC dataset The APPLFUNC dataset contains one observation for each user for each function that the user is allowed to perform. Functions are defined by the FUN_CODE field in the dataset.   When a new user logs on, all observations belonging to that userid are subsetted from APPLFUNC and used to build a main menu unique to that user. DYNHTML dataset The DYNHTML dataset contains one observation for each possible line in the main INTRANET menu. These lines consist of headers, text, and links to other pages. Links are grouped using the GROUP code and print in the order specified in the ORDER variable. There is one heading for each group, which has an order value of 1 so it will print first. The FUN_CODE field in this dataset corresponds to the FUN_CODE field in the APPLFUNC dataset. FUN_CODE determines access while GR",p195-24.pdf

A race to merge, takeover, open new markets and gain control of both local and long distance service. Those companies that wish to win can only offer two things: price and service.  To gain the competitive advantage requires complex statistical quality measurements. The SAS ® system delivers the platform that makes it all possible. USWest ® Telecommunications, as a regulated local telephone service provider, is required to open its market to local competition. In turn USWest's goal is to be given access to the lucrative long distance market. The key to gaining access to the long distance market is demonstrating to State and Federal utility authorities that USWests business practices allow Competitive Local Exchange Carriers (CLEC) a level playing field. No small task when USWest territory covers 14 states and operational systems from several different regional companies. Project Scope In 1997 USWest embarked on the task of developing a system that would provide service level measurements to utility authorities and under contract CLECs. The two business units that had direct interest in the success of the new system were Marketing and Network Operations. Business goals of the two groups where defined and the project was divided between contract measurements and network service measurements. USWest Network Global Measurement Group is chartered as the staff support group responsible for reporting on network-wide service levels. The new Interconnection reporting platform fell within their area of responsibility.  The group has a long history of analytical reporting using the SAS ® system.

"es a project request and tracking system that has been implemented using SAS/IntrNet software. The system allows internal clients of a team of SAS ® developers to request statistical reports and applications, and management to assign resources to these requests. It also provides a means for the developers to record their status on such requests. The client or management can then query project status in order to monitor their progress. INTRODUCTION LabOne, Inc. operates a centralized laboratory in the Kansas City Area and markets clinical, insurance and substance abuse testing services in the United States and internationally.   The Information Technology Department supports clients both internal and external by providing valuable information processed using The SAS System. As a result of growth in the staff and the additional means of output delivery to the client (hard copy, email, fax, and web output), it has become increasingly important to be able to effectively deal with the logging, assignment, and tracking of incoming requests. The decision to develop this particular product using SAS/IntrNet was due primarily to two reasons. Our organization had recently been selected to participate in a pilot telecommuting program; close monitoring of associate status while telecommuting was a key element of this program.

"eneca Pharmaceuticals, Wilmington, DE ABSTRACT According to the SAS Institute's web page (updated April 16, 1998) there are 27 SAS RUGs and LUGs with web pages. This paper will explain the design and coding considerations used in the development of the PhilaSUG site. There are several fundamental considerations in designing a home page that transcend HTML (HyperText Markup Language, the code that describes the structure of a web document's content). These concerns include layout, design, and ease of use. The impacts of various browsers and HTML levels will be discussed. Finally, the basic HTML (level 2 Frames, Style Sheets, and Dynamic HTML will not be covered) used to author the PhilaSUG site will be demonstrated using a popular browser. DESIGN The key to a satisfactory Web page is good design, and design is not something that is done only once; rather, it is an ongoing process of maintaining a harmony between the appearance of the message and the content of the message itself. GOALS/PURPOSE The first step in establishing any Web site is analysis of the intended content and of the audience that will access that material. Before anything is written, a clear understanding of the purpose is necessary, and from that understanding, the tasks to be undertaken through the Web site can be defined. Only after these things are done can a truly useful and organized site be developed.

"This paper explains a simple framework for applying traditional sequential processes (reformat, edits, imputation, etc.) to a hierarchical group of SAS® data sets. The framework merges the data sets using a series of layered DATA step views. It then shows how users can write DATA step code that processes the merged data sets and outputs updated versions of one or more of those data sets. The DATA step code uses a macro to help dynamically create a keep option for each output data set. The DATA step then uses a combination of checking for last. variables and missing values to determine the proper time to output to each data set. This framework largely isolates the complexity of relating the data sets from the complexity of the actual process, it maintains the data set hierarchy, and eliminates the need for any post-process processing (all output data sets are complete at the end of the process data step).",p203-24.pdf

"gy Center, Boulder, Colorado Keywords Canonical discrimination, multiple discriminant analysis, manufacturing PROC CANDISC Abstract Batches of raw material were, with increasing frequency, yielding finished product which was unacceptable. Investigation revealed that all of the raw material met all existing specifications, and the processing parameters had not changed. Univariate methods were used to try to predict batches which would give rise to failing finished product, with little su ccess. Multiple Discriminant Analysis was then used to sort the raw material into bad and good batches. Background Laidlomycin, Sodium Salt (LSS) is a biologically derived raw material used in the manufacture of Laidlomycin Propionate, Potassium Salt (LPPS). On occasion, batches of LSS would, upon processing, give rise to LPPS which did not meet final product specifications, for no known reason. Further, the reason for the failure could be one or both of two different and unrelated causes: 1.  a UV Impurity seen in the reaction completion check. This impurity subsequently disappeared, but batches in which this problem was seen gave rise to LPPS with poor yield and low assay. 2.  brown or amber lumps in the final product. To make matters worse, this was occurring with increasing frequency, approaching fifty percent of the batches manufactured. Results of chemical analyses on the raw material LSS were checked, and all batches were seen to have met all specifications. The processing conditions",p207-24.pdf

"And All With the Push of a Button ! Ray Pass, Ray Pass Consulting THE INTRODUCTION Picture this.   Youve got a ton of data sitting in SAS® data files located on a UNIX box at a different site in a different country, in fact on a different continent, but which can easily be reached via TCP/IP or some other network protocol.   Youve also got a set of supplementary control data sitting in a series of Excel worksheets on the network to which your PC is connected. The task is to create a system which will combine the SAS data with the Excel data, throw in a couple of manually-entered overall selection control parameters which will govern the ultimate mix of data, create a series of   Microsoft Word reports from a predesigned format (margins, fonts, etc), archive the reports on the network with appropriately updated report names, and have it all executed from start to finish by a group of professionals who cannot spell SAS and who can barely get Windows 95 going.   Where to start?   Where to go from there?  Where to end? This was the challenge.  The answers were all in the SAS System, and were actually not that difficult to come by. The final product does it all, starting from a Windows 95 desktop icon which launches SAS with a start macro. The macro presents a simple data entry screen from which the user chooses some selection criteria. After this is accomplished, the macro brings in the Excel data via SAS/ACCESS® Software for PC File Formats.   It then signs the user on to the remote UNIX box via SAS/CONNECT (after first checking to see if the user is already signed on  no sense doing it twice and getting an annoying little message that says, Youre already signed on, dummy!). The Excel data, which by now exist as SAS data sets, are PROC UPLOADed to the remote platform, a ton of SAS processing happens there, and the final report image (PROC PRINTTO) is PROC DOWNLOADed back to the PC environment as a text file.

After scolding the user for attempting to perform this task with hundreds of IF-THEN statements, I suggest they consider an array. In the DATA step, you can put variables into a temporary group called an array. Arrays provide a very powerful tool for group processing. This paper will provide participants with the basics of array processing and is intended for SAS users who have some experience with the DATA step, and no or very little experience with arrays.",p215-24.pdf
"In setting up screens for entering surveys, the best approach to speed up the data entry is to make the screens look as close to the paper survey form as possible. With longer surveys, SAS/FSP helps you on the way to this goal by automatically spilling the unadorned list of variables onto multiple screens. Then you are free to move the variables around and place all the survey question text onto the screens that you need. But, with shorter surveys where the initial list of variables only fits onto one screen, this is not so easy. That is, unless you are aware of a trick to turn on line numbers, making it possible to access a few editor commands to enlarge this one screen into two or more.",p216-24.pdf

"A Maintenance-Free Menu Driven Closure System by Stephen M. Noga, Rho, Inc. Introduction As a clinical trial nears closure, a series of data validation programs are run, sometimes individually, and sometimes in combination with one another. This paper describes a menu driven closure system that was developed using SAS@ Frame, and takes advantage of what were once exclusively SCL functions, but which are now available in the data step. This menu system is maintenance- free because you can add new closure programs to it without ever having to update the menu program. Although this system was developed for use in a CR0 e n v i r o n m e n t , I demonstrate how it can be adapted for use in any organization. The examples in this paper are for a fictitious company, Joes Garage, and any similarity between an actual company and this one is purely coincidental. The Concept The SAS department at Joes Garage is c o m p o s e d of many creative programmers. They are constantly writing newer and better programs. One of their tasks, in conjunction with the car maintenance managers, is to write a series of programs that verify an automobile is up to Joes standards before it leaves the shop. So, following the normal organizational flow, the following three steps occur: the car managers decide what they want the programs to check, and then relay this information to the SAS department; the programmers write the programs to accomplish these checks; and the car processing department runs these programs from an interactive menu which has descriptions of the closure programs. This system works great until the car managers, in their never-ending quest for quality-assurance, develop ideas for new checks. Then they present these requests to the programmers who write the new programs, and upon completion, inform the car processing people that they can now run these new checks. Of course when the car processing people try to run some of these new checks, they cant see them on the menu bec",p218-24.pdf

"tool to retrieve data from DB2 Relational Database Management System (RDMS) tables and to convert them into a SAS dataset. This paper demonstrates the benefits of using this feature, along with a macro that converts a SAS dataset into a list of key values. If these key variables are indexed in a DB2 table, the macro will significantly decrease the required programming and computer processing time. Introduction Creating, accessing, and manipulating data located in the relational objects of a database management system (DBMS) can require extensive programming and computer processing time. Depending on the programming method used, time can be wasted when working with very large DB2 or SAS (1) tables. The application of macros that use indexes has been proven a very time-efficient strategy (2). However, these macros require extensive coding and are complex. The following presentation will introduce an SQL macro, which creates a list of key variables from a SAS d ataset that is then passed to a DB2 or another SAS table to extract data. Merging Two or More SAS Datasets A merge involving multiple variables from two or more large SAS datasets requires a large amount of computer processing time. To circumvent this problem, this merge can be accomplished by focusing on a single key variable from one SAS dataset to extract data from the other SAS dataset(s). This will produce a table that programmers can then refine even further with less chance of exhausting DBMS resources. However, th",p220-24.pdf
"Paper 221 CROSS CROSSOVER STUDIES OFF YOUR LIST Pippa M. Simpson, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas Robert M. Hamer, UMDNJ Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ Shelly Lensing, University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences, Little Rock, Arkansas INTRODUCTION When studying the effect of different drugs or different dose levels (or more generally, simply different treatments) on people, the variability between responses of different people can overwhelm any treatment differences. That is why crossover designs, where each person gets one of each drug or each dose level, are so appealing. Since the order in which people receive a drug may have an effect, the crossover is designed to balance out any period effects. When a carryover effect occurs, that is, when the drugs effect carries over to the next period, there may be difficulties. Nonetheless, the crossover is very appealing theoretically, with power to detect very small differences with relatively much smaller sample sizes. That is the good news. Unfortunately, the best bad news is that the analysis for a crossover can be difficult to program in the SAS ® System. The worst bad news is that the data from a crossover may be nearly useless. Often, even with only a two-armed study (two dose levels or two drugs), dropouts will occur. The period effect is no longer balanced, and only the first period can be analyzed validly. The power of the study is thus gone, and one is left with an independent groups design, with small power resulting from small sample sizes. Many crossover designs confound carryover and period effects. When there is a physiologic or psychologic carryover (and the latter is more common than realized), it may be impossible to detect the treatment effects for which the study was designed. We discuss the analysis of crossover designs, procedures in SAS/STAT ® for these analyses, the difficulties of doing a proper crossover study, and suggest that perhaps we sh",p221-24.pdf
"ABSTRACT A brief introduction is presented in the use of external software, such as DBMS/COPY ® and DBMS/Engines ® by Conceptual Software, Inc., to import external data into the SAS System. DBMS/Engines can be used in libname statements to allow easy access to external data in a method that makes the external data appear as SAS data sets to the user. A summary of tools available within the SAS System will also be discussed. KEY WORDS DBMS/COPY, DBMS/Engines, engines, SAS/ACCESS, Stat/Transfer, translate, transfer, import, export, thirdparty, wizard INTRODUCTION Internal tools that have allowed SAS to communicate to non-SAS database systems have long been available as part of the SAS System. Initially the primary means of transferring data was by creating and reading flat files (usually through the DATA step). Early in Version 6 the procedures DBF and DIF were introduced to translate between these to common file formats on the PC. With the recent explosion of database systems, and the increased power of the desktop workstations the need for the ability to move data into and out of the SAS System has greatly increased. The software industry has responded to this demand with a number of solutions. The availability of internal SAS tools has greatly increased in both number and sophistication. Third party software manufactures now also provide products with the specific purpose of moving data between database systems. This paper will briefly discuss some of the internal SAS data transfer capabilities and will highlight third party products that have proved to be useful. We will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these products and compare them to the internal SAS counterparts. TOOLS AVAILABLE WITHIN SAS SOFTWARE SAS software includes a variety of options to import and export data. These include:  DATA _NULL _  IMPORT/EXPORT WIZARD  ODBC  SAS/ACCESS ®  DDE  OLE A detailed description of SAS System import tools was presented by Andrew Kuligowski and Nancy Ro",p222-24.pdf
"Within the first three days of each month, the Credit Policy MIS group in Commercial Credit produces over 200 reports which must be distributed quickly to more than 70 recipients. Until recently, distribution information was kept in a simple Microsoft Excel ® spreadsheet showing report numbers, program names, report titles, recipient names, and number of copies for each recipient. Although the spreadsheet approach worked well when there were 20 recipients, it became impractical with more than 40 recipients due to space limitation. The goal was to use SAS/FSP ® to manage the distribution data and to use this data to produce check-off lists. Structure of the data set was key to success. To make the SAS/FSP application run smoothly, we wanted one observation per program containing information on all the reports and recipients for that program. A twodimensional array accommodating up to 32 reports and 20 recipients per program worked very well. The tricky part was creating a SAS program to populate the two-dimensional array based on the data derived from the Excel spreadsheet. The purpose of this paper is to show: (1) creation of the SAS twodimensional array, (2) development of the SAS/FSP application, and (3) program used to produce check-off lists.",p223-24.pdf

"This paper describes a table production system of modular design to cope with change: changing sources of information, table production software, and management requirements. The modular design also enables individual pieces to be developed, tested and run in isolation. The core of this system is a standardised SAS data set, which contains one observation for each row of the table. This along with a report template (which has the style and layout of the table) is passed to the table production software. A control SAS data set drives the system and contains a table identifier, the name of the program that produces the standardised data set, the report template name along with additional information. An AF application acts as an interface to get information from the control set, run the program and sends the resulting data set and template name to the table production software. Draft tables are created using Proc Report. The design of the system made it easy to change the final table production software. Different software was tried including Proc Report.

But since then there are no good ways to apply the data resource for Baosteels advanced development. Two reasons are concerned: the first is the situations of Alone Island of Information (AIOI), the information co-operations among the producing areas is very difficult; the second is that there are no effective tools to be used to process the data. Based the knowledge of the actual situations and data warehouse technology we plan to construct the BTQDW to help the operators who work with the quality controls.

This paper gives simple sample code to exemplify the integration of SAS ® software and Microsoft Office software to automate the production of customized graphs. During the presentation, a more fully developed application complete with dialog boxes for generating a variety of graphs via option and command buttons will be demonstrated. I. PROGRAMMING DESIGN There was a request to deliver more than 70 high-resolution line and bar graphs in PowerPoint application within a very short time frame. I pondered on the following considerations in designing the programming approaches: 1. PowerPoint was required by clients as the final media for the graphs, so that they could access the graphs and do some lastminute changes easily. 2. PowerPoint 97 has VBA macros for controlling slide objects, but not for creating graphs. In other words, the current version of PowerPoint lacks the mechanism for supercharging the process. 3. Excel 97 has VBA macros for creating graphs and is capable of automation. 4. The data are in SAS data sets.  Transferring data from SAS to Excel can be automated. 5.

"JT Inc., Dallas Texas Abstract As the cost and complexity of semiconductor manufacturing processes increase, companies such as Texas Instruments, Inc. face increasing pressure to improve the yield of devices produced. Demonstrating, and maintaining, high manufacturing yields is a critical and ongoing effort, which offers significant returns on investment. Small variations in yield can directly impact cost and revenue by millions of dollars. Furthermore, the ability to quickly ramp yield on new technologies can provide a tremendous competitive edge in the marketplace during lucrative early stages of a product cycle. A crucial task in yield improvement efforts is thorough data analysis. TI's Raptor project was launched to provide a standardized architecture for data analysis that could be deployed to multiple wafer fabs, assembly sites, and product groups. The project encompassed designing and building multiple data warehouses, as well as deployment of JJT Inc.'s Maestro software, a metadata-driven analysis system developed with Base SAS ® , SAS/AF ® , SAS/GRAPH ® , SAS/STAT ® , SAS/QC ® , SAS/INSIGHT ® , and SAS/ACCESS ® to ORACLE software in a UNIX environment.

INTRODUCTION At first glance, the SET statement may appear to be a simplistic programming statement and quite unworthy of further analysis.   However, I have found in the course of my career that many SAS programmers do not understand exactly what this command does.   Additionally, many programmers do not possess within their repertoire a set of programming idioms that use the SET statement for solving recurring problems.

The use of Monte Carlo methods allows a variety of designs to be simulated and the results compared to find the design that meets the desired objectives most efficiently.

"ABSTRACT The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate a standard table development methodology and to explain the resulting program design. BACKGROUND Several years ago, the Clinical Research Division (CRD) of Parke- Davis began an analysis of its procedures. This initiative investigated the way CRD processed clinical trials data and from it several process improvement projects were suggested. Our assigned project was to design and develop a common method for gathering requirements and reporting specifications to be used across all therapy areas. The goal was to eliminate routine programming tasks and reduce the amount of validation required for individual programs. OLD PROCESS: In the old clinical trials reporting environment, each therapy area independently developed requirements, specifications and reporting programs. This process: . Consumed many person-hours . Duplicated efforts . Required separate validation for each new program . Impeded the implementation of new technology across the organization NEW PROCESS: The new process begins with a common set of requirements and specifications implemented throughout the CRD organization, leading to the development of a common set of reporting programs. The benefits of the new process are: . Requirements, specifications and programs are reused across therapy areas. . Consistent data handling rules . Requirements, specifications and programs are structured to accommodate variations in study design . Modular design allows for replacement of components to take advantage of changing technology . The programs used to create these standard tables are validated. No additional validation needs to be completed if a standard table is used for the study. Each Workgroup follows a common set of steps to develop their reporting tables. They are as follows: Step 1.

"Using SAS ® Macros to Develop Confidence Intervals for the Weibull and Extreme Value Distribution Using Type II Censored Data Scott M. Jordan and Muhammad H. Zaman, Arkansas Tech University, Math Department, Russellville AR 72801 The Weibull distribution has wide applications, particularly in life distribution. There exists a large body of literature on statistical methods based on the Weibull distribution, but most of the methods require numerical integration or Monte Carlo methods to develop the confidence intervals for model parameters. The reason for the large volume of methods revolves around the fact that there is no two-dimensional sufficient statistic for the shape and scale parameters, and therefore the possibilities of producing estimators are many. There are two methods of developing confidence intervals for the location, scale, and percentiles associated with the extreme value distribution given in equation (2) that will be considered in this paper. SAS macros will be developed for both methods. The next section will discuss the two methods for developing confidence intervals and the last section will discuss the SAS macros. The Weibull p.d.f. is f(t/ , ) = ( / ) -1 exp[-(t/ ) ]   t 0         (1)        where and are the shape and scale parameters, respectively.

"The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate code written in SAS/IML ® software that generates examinees test responses (0/1s) based on a multidimensional item response theory (MIRT) model. This program reads in a file of calibrated item parameters from the NOHARM computer program (Fraser & McDonald, 1986) and generates normally distributed random variables to represent examinees ability levels on each dimension. The SAS/IML program calculates the probability of an examinee obtaining a correct response based on the MIRT model, then compares this probability with a uniform random number to decide the examinees item response. If the probability is larger than the random number, the examinee is credited a correct response (i.e., an item score of 1), otherwise, a zero. The program allows control of the number of samples, the number of examinees, and the number of items for which item responses are generated.",p241-24.pdf
"s may not be aware exist. Some of these features are first being documented with Version 7 of the SAS ® System, although they are present in Version 6. DYNAMIC OPENS OF SAS DATA SETS One of the features that I've always wanted to see in the DATA step was a way to dynamically specify SAS data sets. You've been able to dynamically specify input and output files via the FILEVAR= option, but in the past there was no way to specify SAS data sets except by explicit reference. However, starting in Release 6.11 of the SAS System (and 6.09E on the mainframes), the functions that used to only exist in SCL were made available to the DATA step. These functions, OPEN, SET, and FETCH, allow you to dynamically open and read observations from arbitrary SAS data sets. As an example, consider three SAS data sets, each with the variable X. The data sets DSET1, DSET2, and DSET3, have the same prefix but a different numeric suffix. We can read each of these by constructing their names, using the OPEN function to open a data set, SET to establish an association with variables in the DATA step, and FETCH to read from the data set. Here is some sample code to do so: data dset1; x=1; run; data dset2; x=2; run; data dset3; x=3; run; data temp;     length x 8;     do i=1 to 3;         dsname='dset'||put(i,1.);         dsid = open(dsname,'I');         call set(dsid);         obsnum=0;         do while(fetch(dsid) = 0);            obsnum+1;            put 'reading obs ' obsnum                ' from ' dsn",p242-24.pdf
"Graphically Exploring Multidimensional Data in a Web Browser --  using new features from SAS/GRAPH Connie X. Li, Romac International Inc. James Sun, Constat Systems Inc. Introduction The advantage of paperless distribution of reports through internet or intranet is obvious. We would argue that the web technology is one of the best tools in delivering and disseminating information. In real world, data often reflect a complex relationship among many factors. Those factors are often inter-related. Presenting such a multidimensional data posts challenges in a typical 2D display space. In text format, many have tried to tabulate data with split columns and rows in order to squeezed in more than two dimensions (or factors). In graphic world, a similar approach is applying overlay to place many images as we can. As a result, we often get cluttered images which often bury the pivotal relationship we want to explored. To overcome the shortcoming of such an approach, we need an interactive method to retrieve information when we need. The drill-down mechanism not only preserves the precise information about relationship among primary factors, but allows user to uncover important patterns in the data for those non-primary factors as well. Output Delivery System and New SAS/GRAPH The Output Delivery System (ODS) implements and controls the formatting of all SAS procedure outputs. All procedures produce ODS output object. Within this object, there are two components control output data and output template. The first component moves procedure output into ODS. The second one dictates format and appearance when the output is data rendering. Currently with ODS, SAS output supports HTML and other widely used formats. You can create Web capable graphic file format directly with appropriate ODS statement. Because the supporting of HTML, the process to create web enabled SAS output is much more convenient and transparent. It allows creation of HTML documents in either batch or interactiv",p243-24.pdf
"Many quality and performance measures are available on U S WESTs Intranet using the SAS System. The Vice Presidents and Executive Directors have asked for their own Scorecards on the Web which show only their measures on one page. The scorecards were required to have the results and targets of each measure on a daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, and year-to-date basis. This paper talks about putting the information together from different data sets onto each scorecard with the same columns. The columns with the time-based results, were computed using SAS date functions. The values were also converted to character formats in order to have percents (%), dollars ($), and numbers displayed in a column.

"Rock Spring Drive Reston, VA 20191 Bethesda, MD 20817 Abstract: This paper provides a web-based system using SAS, HTML and CGI/PERL to provide rudimentary and complex Sybase DBMS performance metrics for Unix based system operations. Sybase SQL Server performance data is collected by Sybase Historical Server allowing for the collection of performance information with minimal impact on the server. The SAS System (Base SAS, Macro, STAT and SAS/Graph) is especially well suited to analyzing and visualizing these data. Its graphical, data mining and statistical capabilities coupled with its ability to access data from a multitude of formats, including DBMS, PC and ASCII files, provides an all in one performance analysis toolkit. In this paper, we present a World Wide Web interface to exploit the power of SAS processing for open system delivery of information. The SAS system processes calculations much faster than the functions supplied with DBMS technology. SAS Access to Sybase SQL Pass through facility allows the use of DBMS data access technology. Therefore, this approach exploits the strengths of two technologies to optimize information delivery. The skill level for SAS programmers requires an intermediate to advanced programmer track.

"Center, Los Angeles, CA Gail P. Grant, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA Bruce Davidson, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, CA ABSTRACT The Physician Profiling Report System, consisting of bar and bubble graphs, was written using SAS/GRAPH software. Both data extraction on the IBM ® mainframe and sub- sequent graphing on the PC are macro driven and require no manual intervention. The focus of this paper is the use of the Annotate facility in two instances to improve the appearance of the graphs which this system generates. INTRODUCTION Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (CSMC), located in Los Angeles, California, is one of the largest private academic hospitals in the Western United States. With over 850 beds, this facility admits over 40,000 inpatients and 90,000 outpatients annually. Its work force is comprised of about 7,000 employees, 1,700 physicians on the voluntary staff, and 200 clinical faculty. The volume and complexity of the institutions data has sometimes made it difficult to present easy to grasp and usable reports. The SAS ® system has generally been the tool of choice for statistical reporting at CSMC, primarily because of its powerful data management and number-crunching capability. In the effort to continuously improve Cedars-Sinai Me- dical Centers clinical quality, the Resource and Outcomes Management Department at this institution introduced Physician Dashboard Profile Reports.

"s of using the ROUND function in the SAS ® System. By default, numbers with a trailing 5 are rounded away from zero (i.e., 0.15 to 0.2 and -0.25 to -0.3), neglecting any numerical precision errors that a computers hardware limitations may introduce. In some instances, this type of rounding can lead to an overestimation of the true mean of a set of numbers, as illustrated by the simulation described in this paper. The macro code presented in this paper eliminates this bias by randomly rounding up or down, depending on the outcome of a normally distributed random variable. BACKGROUND PRECISION ERROR Numerical precision errors can sometimes produce rounding results that do not match up with, what some people term, your pencil-and-paper results. The first problem we encounter is the computers limitation in its ability to represent the infinite domain of the real number system. The computational answer to this problem is found in floating point arithmetic, where an arbitrary number, x, is represented by the expression: x = ± 0.d 1 d 2 d k x 10 n . Here, k is the number of significant digits, and n is the exponent of the number x. Suppose we try to represent an irrational number such as with this expression. Our resultant number will undoubtedly be truncated after k significant digits, and will not be the true value we are after, no matter how precise we get.

"ervices, Inc. Figure 1 Abstract Although SAS Version 6 is primarily year 2000 compliant, it may nevertheless be advantageous to find date-related strings that are associated with two digit years. Find2000 is a search tool written in SAS that facilitates finding date-related strings. Find2000 has the flexibility to customize the search criteria and save the search results in several ways. Introduction While the SAS Version 6 is primarily year 2000 compliant, end-user applications may not be. Though the YEARCUTOFF= option allows you to set the century window, it does not by itself identify date-related strings in your program or data. It may be important to identify date-related strings for the following reasons:  The SAS system has the capability to access non-SAS data files from other systems such as Sybase and Oracle. These systems may not be Year 2000 compliant. This issue is more significant if you are using SQL pass-through.  ASCII files that are used to store data may have date values stored with two-digit years; e.g. 980131.  Many sites are still running SAS Version 5. SAS Version 5 is not year 2000 compliant, nor will it ever be. The YEARCUTOFF= option is not available. This is a particularly significant issue for those sites that have no intention to upgrade to later SAS versions.  SAS Version 6 is primarily year 2000 compliant. The key word here is primarily.

Wagner, Congressional Budget Office, Washington, DC Eva R. Helgeson, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN James M. Naessens, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN Jill M. Killian, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN and Roger W. Evans, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN INTRODUCTION A collaboration of researchers at the Mayo Medical Center and Olmsted Medical Center created a SAS ® data warehouse of detailed billing data. This unique warehouse contains billing data for most of Olmsted County from 1987 to present. The challenge for the developers was to create a warehouse of all historical data stored on different platforms and in a variety of different forms from five different institutions. The goal is to give researchers easily accessible, consistent data for analysis. SAS tools were used in the development of the warehouse and are used for accessing, manipulating and analyzing data. OBJECTIVES As an adjunct to the Rochester Epidemiology Project, researchers from the Mayo Clinic and the Olmsted Medical Center have collaborated to create a SAS data warehouse for population-based studies of health care utilization and costs. Detailed billing data, representing the vast majority of medical care services for residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, are available since 1987. Because most research questions have relevance beyond the boundaries of Olmsted County, the costing methodology, when applied to the detailed utilization, provides a standard unit cost measure that is adjusted for both inflation to a base year and geographic variation. The methodology used protects proprietary cost data from disclosure and will provide consistent unit cost estimates for ongoing research studies of health care costs.

SAS ® PROC GENMOD with the Poisson distribution option can calculate the predicted adjusted rate at the mean levels of the independent variables. Due to nonlinear nature of the model, F(E(X)) is not equal to E(F(X)). A corrected adjusted rate is calculated by multiplying a constant. Macro ADJ_POIS can calculate the predicted and corrected adjusted rates and their upper and lower 95% confidence intervals, can display the analysis results and can provide output datasets with adjusted statistics and CIs and with beta estimates, standards errors and P-values.

"tatistical modeling gained widespread acceptance in the credit industry, portfolio managers have struggled with how to build predictive models on their true, through-the-door population. In many cases, one third or more of the applicants that cross a lenders threshold are denied credit. Since some of any lenders approvals fail to perform as agreed, its reasonable to assume that some of the lenders rejected applicants would have likewise paid satisfactorily. Any through-the-door risk model, then, must take all applicants into account, not just the ones whose performance is a known quantity. This paper focuses on three commonly-used methods of inferring behavior on these rejected applicants Cohort Performance, Parceling, and Augmentation. Each method has its own strengths and weaknesses. MODELING ON KNOWN GOODS AND BADS In any credit modeling procedure, its tempting to stay as close as possible to known information. Because of the rigid regulatory yet highly competitive environment most creditors operate in, any theoretical or esoteric solutions generally take a backseat to a more quantifiable, dollars-and-cents answer.

"Measures of market risk project the possible loss in value of a portfolio due to movements in financial markets. Credit risk measures project the possible losses in a portfolio due to poor performance by a counterparty such as a downgrading in credit rating or an actual default on an obligation. In the past, financial institutions have measured market and credit risk separately. As global markets have matured, financial institutions have recognized that market and credit risks are intertwined and should be measured in an integrated manner. The challenge facing risk managers attempting to achieve this integrated measurement include a continuum of issues from fundamental data management to implementing complex analytical techniques robustly, to producing effective reports in a timely fashion. Risk Dimensions provides risk managers with an integrated environment in which the obstacles to integrating market and credit risk management can be overcome. Risk One common point of confusion is that the term risk management and credit risk can have multiple meanings in the financial services industry, all of which are correct. For Risk Dimensions, risk management refers to financial risk (loss in value of a security or portfolio). Risk Dimensions is a firmwide risk management solution. Specifically, Risk Dimensions is designed for;  aggregating market risk measures  loss in value due to normal fluctuations in financial markets, and credit risk measures  loss in value from a change in credit rating or failure of a counter party to a transaction.

The inputs are classified as either deterministic (for example month or year where the future values are known) or nondeterministic (for example interest rates or price, where future values are not known and must be forecasted or estimated from the data).

"Advances in Multiple Comparisons and Multiple Tests using the SAS ® System Peter H. Westfall, Mail Stop 2101, Texas Tech University, Lubbock TX 79409 Randall D. Tobias, SAS Institute, Inc. 1. Introduction This article provides a summary of the upcoming book Multiple Comparisons and Multiple Tests using the SAS ® System, by Westfall et al. (1999) and introduces some of the new methods and capabilities it presents. Whenever you want to make more than one decision in a statistically valid way, multiple inferences are involved. There are numerous alternative solutions for multiple inference problems some are very good, some perform reasonably well, and some are of questionable value. The wide variety of methods that are available can make the choice of technique difficult. In Westfall et al. (1999) we explain the various methods, along with their pitfalls and advantages. The material in the book is self-contained, requiring only a moderate statistical background. We apply the methods to real data, giving examples from many areas, including business, medicine, sociology, and engineering. One goal we had in writing this book was to unify the presentation of the diverse multiple inference methods, and to simplify the use of software.   The proper choice of a multiple inference procedure depends upon your inference objectives and data structure. While there are procedures in SAS/STAT® software for such inferences, such as the GLM, MIXED, and MULTTEST procedures, we realized through the course of writing the book that several types of problems ""fall through the cracks,"" and are not particularly well accommodated by any of the existing procedures. To fill this gap, we developed a set of SAS ® macro language programs that implement more general and more recently developed multiple inference techniques than are available in the procedures mentioned above.

"Modeling Event Count data with Proc GENMOD and the SAS System Matthew Flynn The Hartford Introduction Event count data are distinguished by being positive and integer valued with often small numbers of unique values. Examples include just about anything measured by counts or summary frequency data. Standard ordinary least squares (OLS) regression modeling requires the assumption that the model errors, i , are independently and identically distributed, (i.i.d.)~ N(0, ), normal random variables. In practice, however, departures from this ideal situation are common. This broader class of regression models can be handled under a powerful and flexible set of models called General Linear Models, or GLMs, see McCullagh and Nelder (1989) . SAS provides a number of tools built to accommodate a variety of different modeling situations, but unfortunately, many users are on unfamiliar ground, and consequently are less confident in these modeling situations. This article attempts to illustrate, through example and discussion, some of the unique features of modeling event count data with SAS and Proc GENMOD. Preliminary Discussion Poisson Distribution Using a set of parameters ranging from a mean of 1.5 to 10.5, the following graphs (figures 1-4) illustrate the shape the Poisson distribution for increasing levels of the single parameter, the mean. (The graphs reproduce the output in Long (1997), figure 8.1, page 219.) At low levels of the mean, this discrete distribution is sharply skewed, but quickly tends to a normal distribution as the mean goes above ten. If one has a frequency distribution of counts with a mean at fifteen or above, the results for modeling a Poisson distribution will be very close to an OLS normal model fit.

The analysis of a North Central Cancer Treatment Group (NCCTG) oncology clinical trial involving a two-period two-treatment crossover design is presented as an example. Results for the Bayesian model are compared to standard linear models analysis of variance procedures. INTRODUCTION The past decade has seen an explosion of interest and research into new methods for statistical computing. At the forefront of this explosion has been the discovery by statisticians of methods grouped under the heading of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). Using MCMC methods, statisticians have been able to propose, fit, and make inferences on a wide variety of complex models that were previously computationally infeasible. One area that MCMC computing has made great inroads into standard statistical practice is hierarchical linear models. In a hierarchical model, the model is specified in stages. For example, in one model for analyzing data from a cross-over clinical trial, described in detail by Sloan et al (1997), with repeated measurements per person, the first level of the model relates the observations in each period to a number of fixed effects, plus a subject specific random effect. In the second level of the model, the subject specific random effects are a",p266-24.pdf
"on in airplane wing panel manufacturing is widespread. It is thought that cooling a drill bit with a blast of freon leads to a smoother hole surface. Since the price of freon doubles each year, and it's related to ozone layer depletion, there is a desire to reduce its use. The airplane manufacturer was interested in whether or not freon could be replaced by a lubricant. The goal of this experiment was to test whether the lubricant was at least the equivalent to freon for hole smoothness. Purpose: This paper will describe the statistical modeling and analysis of this fractional factorial split-plot experiment using the SAS ® Mixed procedure. Two methods of modeling the data will be examined. The first method is very similar to what many automatic statistical packages may do. Method: Proc Mixed was used to analyze the experiment as a completely randomized and an incomplete block (split-plot) design structure. Practical techniques to analyze the experiment were demonstrated. Summary: Although Proc Mixed was used to analyze the experiment, correctly specifying the statistical model is still of the utmost importance in getting good answers.

"ss development strategies often begin with market segmentation, which involves the grouping of customers and non-customers with similar characteristics. Segmentation is useful to the extent that customers within a segment have similar purchasing behavior and/or profitability that differs from customers in other segments. Many companies segment their markets and customers using a matrix approach that groups customers along two dimensions, sales and SIC code, for example. This paper describes the procedures for developing a multi-dimensional market segmentation strategy using the FASTCLUS procedure in SAS/STAT ® software. Data set development, data cleaning, user supplied parameters and cluster interpretation are examined using an example data set of over 60,000 businesses in California. Emphasis is placed on the subjective decisions required with the development of market segments using statistical algorithms. THE BUSINESS NEED Market segmentation is perhaps one of the most important strategic concepts in market research. Most companies use some type of segmentation to group existing or prospective customers. Segmentation strategies provide the basis for specific marketing plans. The core concept of market segmentation is that rather than viewing markets as one large homogeneous group, they are better thought of as being comprised of several subgroups. Each subgroup is unique in its characteristics, needs, and purchasing behavior. Strategic marketing plans will use a differen",p270-24.pdf
"E, ASHINGTON               Fractionally integrated random processes are examined as an alternative to short-memory ARIMA models resulting from integer differencing.

"ract The term statistical graphics can have several meanings. The most common use is a visual display of data possibly including some summary statistic such as a regression line running through a scatter plot. Another meaning, that which I hope to address herein, is a visual display that provides a clearer understanding of some statistical principle . 1.  Introductory example A nice example is Figure 1.  This graph deals with confidence intervals. What exactly is a confidence interval? You read in your textbooks the formula for the calculation of a confidence interval. For example, after studying the properties of the normal distribution with mean you are told how to compute a confidence interval for the mean. You are told to compute the sample average Y then the confidence interval Y t s n ± 2 / .   This gives two numbers L and U that serve as upper and lower bounds for the confidence interval. Now that you know how to compute a confidence interval, what is it that you have computed, that is, what do the numbers mean? For example, if L=10 and U = 25 does that somehow mean there is a 95% probability that is between 10 and 25? Of course not - is a single (albeit unknown) number and does not vary at all so asking how often this single number is between 10 and 25 makes no sense. It either is or is not between 10 and 25. In fact, most well written textbooks make a point of saying that a confidence interval does not have a 95% probability of containing . A well constructed graph",p274-24.pdf
"The SWEEP operator in SAS/IML ® software is used to solve two classes of multivariate problems, namely stepwise predictor selection in (1) interdependence analysis as defined by Beale, Kendall, and Mann (1967), and (2) multivariate, multiple regression.  Though both problems have lain quiescent, they are resurrected here because of their relevance to analysis of massive data sets. In both cases, each forward selection step is followed by a look back, where the latter involves switching 1tuples, 2-tuples, or higher k-tuples of previously selected predictors. In this sense, both algorithms resemble SELECTION=MAXR in procedure REG, but with the capability of simultaneously switching more than single predictor variables in and out of the current model, and with the added important provision of a multivariate response. Examples of interdependence analysis are drawn from electrical engineering, yielding subsets of fundamental parameters which are used to characterize general purpose IC chips. Selection in multivariate, multiple regression is illustrated by two examples focusing on sources of variation for dioxin and furan yields in municipal waste incineration.

"Canonical Correspondence Analysis in SAS Software Laxman Hegde   Dayanand Naik Department of Mathematics       Department of Math and Statistics Frostburg State University Old Dominion University Frostburg, MD 21532 Norfolk, VA 23529 Ecologists analyze species-environment relations from data on biological communities and their environment. Generally, the data of occurrence or abundance of each species of a taxonomic group is collected at several sites. Also data on a set of environment variables that are important in explaining the variation in species are collected. A ""site"" is a basic sampling unit separated in space or time from other sites, e.g. a quadrant, a woodlot or a light trap. Canonical Correspondence Analysis (CCA) is a multivariate technique to relate composition of a species when species have bell-shaped response curve with respect to environmental gradients. Note that statisticians interpret CCA as canonical correlation analysis in standard multivariate statistical analysis. Although canonical correspondence analysis and canonical correlation analysis are closely related, there are some subtle differences between the two techniques. Ter Braak (1986) has shown a complete derivation and applications of CCA techniques. Also, Ter Braak (1988) has developed a computer program CANOCO to perform CCA and several other multivariate statistical techniques to analyze species-environmental relations. CANOCO is perhaps a widely used program by ecologists and biologists, but not so well known for the researchers in other fields. In this paper, we of CCA as discussed in Ter Braak review mathematical contents (1986) and develop a SAS program to perform CCA and biplots to present a species environmental relationship. Data Let y represent the abundance of the k species at the i site where i = 1,2,..., n and k = 1,2, ..., m.  Let z represent the value of  the j environmental variable at the i site, where j = 1,2, ..., q.  Also x represents the unknown score (ordination",p278-24.pdf
"Software Release 6.12, PROC VARIOGRAM and PROC KRIGE2D, allow two dimensional geostatistical modeling and estimation. A brief background in theory precedes a full geostatisticat analysis of spatially correlated data. The data are bathymetric soundings of depth in Lake Huron, presented in the NOAA Report ERL GLERL-16 Computerized 6afhymef/y and Shorelines of the Great Lake (Schwab and Sellers, 1996). INTRODUCTION Geostatistics was defined as I .. the application of the formalism of random functions to the reconnaissance and estimation of natural phenomena by G. Matheron, who introduced the theory of regionalized variables for mining applications. The technique of geostatistics is used to create of model of spatially correlated random variables based on samples, and then estimate values at unsampled locations using the model. WHY GEOSTATISTICS? Many classical statistical methods rely upon the independence of data samples for inference. In practice the independence is often counter- intuitive. Many natural processes exhibit a correlation in the spatial dimension. Samples at closer distances are more alike than those at further distances. In some cases, the direction of the points affects the relationship. Finally, there may be a distance beyond which samples are effectively independent. Geostatistical methods model the covariance structure in a process. The predictive model for covarlance is selected from a family of functions, variograms, and fit to empirical data to obtain",p279-24.pdf
"Various checks on consistency and changes in the SAS programs in large scale projects can be efficiently implemented using the SAS language itself. This is done by obtaining lists of all files and their requisites in the project program and data directories and comparing these lists; extracting from the SAS log files information on permanent SAS data sets used in the corresponding SAS runs; and utilizing information from standardized comment fields in the headers of SAS programs. The information gathered in the course of this process is also useful for project tracking. The SAS language features that make this possible include interaction with DOS (Windows NT) command output using the PIPE device type in the FILENAME statement; information in the SAS log on the date and time of the SAS run and on physical names of LIBREFs; and the two-level name syntax for permanent data sets and the limited ways of referencing existing data sets in a SAS program (SET, MERGE and other statements in DATA step; DATA= option in procedures; etc.).",p28-24.pdf
"Reliability refers to the extent to which the same score is obtained on multiple administrations. Interrater reliability is evaluated by comparing scores assigned to the same targets by two or more raters. Kappa is perhaps the most commonly used index of interrater agreement. Kappa is scaled to be 0 when the amount of agreement is what would be expected to be observed by chance and 1 when there is perfect agreement. Kappa can be obtained from SAS PROC FREQ, but this procedure can only handle complete data (i.e., each rater uses every possible choice on the response scale at least once). For incomplete data, one will either be unable to get kappa (if non-square table) or one will get a wrong kappa (if irregular square table) through SAS ® . This paper introduces a SAS ® macro procedure that calculates the correct kappa for either complete or incomplete data, and allows the user to specify any of three different weighting schemes. The SAS ® products included are Base SAS ® , SAS/STAT ® , SAS/IML ® and SAS ® MACRO. This procedure can be run on any computer platform with a working SAS ® system by even an entry-level analyst.",p280-24.pdf
"PowerReg is a user-written SAS® macro program for computing statistical power and sample sizes necessary to detect a treatment effect given a variety of designs and sampling plans. This program adopts a computer-intensive approach for deriving statistical power curves for different ranges of sample size choice. Although the primary focus of the program is to obtain adequate sample sizes for testing the hypothesis of a given treatment effect difference, emphasis is also placed on the method to use to generate such statistical computations under special circumstances. We illustrate the use of the program with a data set collected from a clinical trial testing a new nutritional formula for low birth weight babies. Its functionality also covers carrying out a sensitivity analysis for a different magnitude of treatment effect difference and repeated analysis of the same data set after elimination of outliers. Results are presented in a simple-to-read tabular format. An optional graphical plot (using SAS/GRAPH®) of power versus sample size can also be requested.",p281-24.pdf
"Oftentimes in epidemiological research, we deal with case-control studies in which the exposures have more than two levels (i.e., we are looking at an exposure by outcome table that is rx2). However, the CMH option in PROC FREQ will compute the estimates of risk for only 2x2 tables, and not for the more general rx2 tables. Datasets are created for each comparison against the referent exposure group, and PROC FREQs are run on these individual datasets. The PROC FREQ then is re-run for the entire rx2 table to obtain the estimate of the overall linear association. This can become quite a tedious undertaking very quickly. In this paper, we present macro code that automates the creation of the separate datasets and the subsequent PROC FREQs, and summarizes the cell counts and statistics of interest in an easily interpretable table for the client. It is aimed at a moderate skill level; it uses macro code, PROC FREQ, and PROC TABULATE; and, though currently it is written to execute in PC SAS TM , the code is not specific to an operating system.",p282-24.pdf

"The advent of managed health care has focused attention on the methodology for analyzing patient health care costs. Standard methods of analysis apply to a varying degree, but there are unique challenges inherent in constructing and analyzing cost data. Adjustments in basic statistical procedures are necessary to account for changes in the value of money over time, marked skewness due to catastrophic costs and censoring from both left and right. A number of authors have developed novel approaches for the analysis of patient cost data (Fenn et al, 1996; Siegel et al, 1996; Zhou et al, 1997; Etzioni et al, 1998). We present an array of alternative statistical machinations for cost data achieved through varied application of the SAS system.

"A matched case-control design is a common approach used to assess diseaseexposure relationships, and is often a more efficient method than an unmatched design. However, for the valid analysis of such an approach, a modeling technique that incorporates the matched nature of the data is needed. This prohibits the use of a standard unconditional logistic regression analysis generally available in PROC LOGISTIC. A stratified conditional logistic model has the same flexibility as an unconditional model, yet can still take into account the correlation structure attributable to matching. This paper presents a SAS macro that fits a conditional logistic regression model to matched or finely stratified data using the PHREG procedure. The macro enhances standard PHREG output by producing summary tables and statistics used to describe the matched sets. It also calculates several regression diagnostics, some not available in PHREG, that can be used to assess model fit.

"awski, Ph.D. MCI WorldCom ABSTRACT The marriage of MCI and WorldCom has created an enormous worldwide computing network with over one billion dollars in computing assets. The MCI WorldCom computing environment includes several very large central electronic complexes containing arrays of central and distributed computers. The entire network is remotely managed from Colorado Springs, Colorado. It serves thousands of distributed interactive users at hundreds of locations throughout the world. To effectively manage these corporate assets, decision-makers need accurate forecasts of midrange workload performance in order to justify requests for acquisition of new central processing units. This paper describes our use of the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) technique to accurately forecast workload consumption of midrange resources with 95% statistical confidence. In order to demonstrate the robustness of the ARIMA construct, and to facilitate calibration of the models, we graphically illustrate how they are used to compare forecasted to actual values of CPU consumption.

"both fixed and random effects enter nonlinearly are becoming increasingly popular. These models have a wide variety of applications, two of the most common being nonlinear growth curves and overdispersed binomial data. A new SAS/STAT® procedure, NLMIXED, fits these models using likelihood-based methods. This paper presents some of the primary features of PROC NLMIXED and illustrates its use with two examples. INTRODUCTION The NLMIXED procedure fits nonlinear mixed models, that is, models in which both fixed and random effects are permitted to have a nonlinear relationship to the response variable.   These models can take various forms, but the most common ones involve a conditional distribution for the response variable given the random effects. PROC NLMIXED enables you to specify such a distribution by using either a keyword for a standard form (normal, binomial, Poisson) or SAS programming statements to specify a general distribution. PROC NLMIXED fits the specified nonlinear mixed model by maximizing an approximation to the likelihood integrated over the random effects. Different approximations to the integral are available, and the two principal ones are adaptive Gaussian quadrature and a first-order Taylor series approximation. You can use a variety of alternative optimization techniques to carry out the maximization; the default is a dual quasi-Newton algorithm. Successful convergence of the optimization problem results in parameter estimates along with their approxima",p287-24.pdf

"Austin, TX ABSTRACT There are a number of different parallel architectures: parallel hardware implementations, parallel file systems, parallel application enablement software, and parallel databases. Tests were performed to evaluate and demonstrate the positive peformance effects of each of these architectures when used with the SAS System. A brief description of these tests, and their results, are presented in this paper. INTRODUCTION There are are a large number of SAS customers running many, if not all, the SAS products on many different computer architectures. As parallel architectures become more commonplace, from the desktop to supercomputing, it will be advantageous to understand how those parallel architectures can be used by SAS customers. It will also be of benefit for SAS customers to understand the performance effects of using SAS on those parallel architectures, so as to be able to correctly build and run their SAS environments.     To this end, this paper will discuss actual test environments where different parallel architectures (Symmetric Multi Processing and Massively Parallel Processing) are used and the studied performance characteristics are discussed. Also tested and discussed are parallel software environments, from third party software developers, on those different hardware architectures.     Also investigated and reported will be the use of Relational DataBase Management Systems (RDBMS), flat files and SAS data structures.

Factors like disk configuration, striping hardware/logical, thread count, data organization, index types, and memory and their effect to the overall performance of the SAS/SPD Server software will be discussed. Examples and actual performance benchmark results will be presented. Introduction The Scalable Performance Data Server (SPD Server) is a data base engine designed to scale to the performance needs of an organization. The environment is secure, easy to administer, handles large files, operates 24 hours a day 7 days a week, accessible to end users, and is full SAS language compatible. The software is written to take advantage of Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP). Symmetric Multi-Processing (SMP), also known as parallel processing takes a given task and divides it into many smaller parts known as threads. As each thread completes its share of the overall task the results are combined with the results of the other threads. Threading allows the system to fully utilize resources such as CPU cycles, I/O, and memory. The SAS/SPD Server software uses SMP technology to optimize where clause processing, load data, build indexes, and sort data. SMP technology is well suited for multi-user computing environments such as warehousing and data mart applications.

This paper presents a discussion of the state of the Windows platform and how the Nashville Release of the SAS System takes advantage and integrates with the operating system. SAS System exploitation of advanced server hardware is also covered. INTRODUCTION In the history of SAS software on the Windows platform, SAS Institute has provided various methods of taking advantage of features and other applications available on personal computers. In addition to reflecting the native look and feel of the Windows platform, interoperability has been a hallmark of the SAS System for Windows.   This interoperability has taken the form of support for e-mail, Lotus Notes, Windows Explorer integration, and other methods of interacting with client application software. As the Windows platform has evolved as a capable server platform, this focus has shifted towards server exploitations of high-end hardware capabilities and large-scale processing abilities in Windows NT.   These exploitations center around the most effective use of the SAS System on large NT Server systems in applications such as data warehousing and decision support.

We will look at using ODBC under the latest operating conditions such as Windows 98 and SAS 6.12 and get a sneak peek at SAS 7.0. We will review the definition of ODBC, how to set up databases so that they can be accessed from SAS and all other ODBC compliant applications such as MS Access, Paradox, MS Excel and Lotus 123. We will compare ODBC with other third party products such as DBMS Copy. CONNECTIVITY In my opinion, data should be universal. We shouldnt have to worry about what format to save our data in. We should be able to access all our data with any application without having to know anything about the format, or file extensions. We should be able to exchange data with anyone without a long conversation about how it is stored. We are a long way from achieving this. ODBC ODBC is a standard developed by Microsoft to create a common method of accessing information from a variety of data sources. ODBC allows applications to access different database file types whose drivers are installed on your machine. Your system comes configured with several standard ODBC drivers.

"Paper 297 Untangling and Reformatting NT PerfMon Data to Load a UNIX ® SAS ® Database With a  Software-Intelligent Data-Adaptive Application Heather McDowell, Wisconsin Electric Power Co., Milwaukee, WI LeRoy Bessler, Ph.D., Strong Smart Systems, Bessler Consulting and Research, Fox Point, WI Abstract: Input to the application is a concatenation of NT Performance Monitor data sets from several servers. Each server can present a different record layout, due to, e.g., differing number of processors, logical disks, paging files, etc. Rather than using a separate record type for each category of resource (processor, disk, etc.), all measurement data elements for a single time interval are strung out by NT PerfMon in one long observation. The collection of datetimestamped observations for a server is preceded by a header record of what are, in effect, textual column headings. The data set is like a collection of unloaded spreadsheets, where layout differs from server to server, and where layout for a single server can change from day to day. The target database has separate tables for each resource category (CPU, Logical Disk, Paging, etc.), each keyed by server name, resource ID (to distinguish processors from one another, etc.) and datetimestamp. The Software-Intelligent application solution uses Base SAS language and macro processing. Data is useless if it is not presented in an informative, understandable, and accessible format. Transforming data into the right format for your targeted audience is sometimes quite a challenge. Performance data collected through the PerfMon utility of Windows NT presents that challenge to SAS* users. The PerfMon utility has the ability to collect several hundred different statistics regarding the performance of the Windows NT servers. The data it produces consists of one heading record for the file, followed by one detail record for each time of collection. This flat file is useless if left in its original format.

Within the pages to follow, the author will explore many such difficulties with tape and the ways to overcome the difficulties. For example, tape devices are sequential storage units rather than random access devices, as are disks. What problems does sequential storage bring? Can multiple SAS data sets be stored within a single SAS data library on tape without destroying each other? What effective SAS capabilities are sacrificed when using tape? How does the user allocate a SAS data library on tape from within SAS? All these questions and more will be answered in the pages to follow as the reader learns how to use SAS data libraries on tape. I NTRODUCTION When our SAS data sets get too big to store on disk devices, all is not lost. The SAS System can use tape devices as SAS data libraries almost as well as it does disk devices. When your SAS data libraries are on tape, there are some things you cannot do that you can do SAS data libraries on disk. Most of what you will do will not be any different when using tape devices.

"l Storage Access Method (VSAM) has been a popular data storage construct on MVS systems. VSAM is the cornerstone of online applications such as IMS and CICS, and is widely used in vendor packages and inhouse-written batch applications. Its flexibility and automatic internal data management routines have long made it an access method of choice. This paper focuses on how SAS programmers can optimize the processing of VSAM data sets by manipulating VSAM buffers. It presents specific techniques and methodologies for determining what kind, and how many VSAM buffers to allocate to a SAS program. If implemented correctly, these buffering methodologies will greatly reduce disk I/O's, reduce CPU time, and lead to better job turnaround time. INTRODUCTION VSAM buffering is a powerful tool SAS programmers can employ to improve the efficiency of programs that access VSAM data sets. This paper details the methodology for exploiting VSAM buffers in SAS programs for each of the three types of VSAM data sets. The paper begins by reviewing the three types of VSAM data sets and their processing characteristics.   It examines VSAMs default buffering and explains the general buffer strategy. It describes the basic tools for obtaining the information needed to determine how many buffers to use for processing a VSAM data set. Then, the buffering algorithms for each access of each type of VSAM data set are presented. The paper concludes by presenting benchmarks made by running SAS programs accessin",p302-24.pdf
"A ® as a performance enhancement. This paper introduces hiperspaces under MVS, and the applicable SAS options to invoke hiperspace use. Also, attention is given to tuning the use of hiperspaces within MVS (i.e. MVSs SRM parameters). Performance gains can be astonishing with little or no work on the part of the user. Finally, specific case study results will be given. Introduction All SAS jobs (either batch or interactive) use a WORK file to store temporary data for the life of the job. The WORK file is normally placed on DASD, or occasionally VIO (MVSs virtual input/output). A SAS job could incur a great deal of time reading and writing data to this DASD workfile if the job manipulates a lot of temporary data. MVS tuning, in general, attempts to reduce or eliminate physical I/O to DASD since it usually constitutes the largest portion of a jobs runtime. Hiperspaces(H/S) offers an alternative to the usual DASD WORK file with reduced runtimes for virtually all jobs, and substantially reduced runtimes for I/O intensive jobs. MVS/ESA Hiperspaces MVSs processor storage consists of Central Storage (CS), Expanded Storage (ES), and Auxiliary Storage (AUX). CS & ES are solid-state type memory and AUX is DASD. A jobs virtual storage is backed by processor storage (i.e. a jobs data buffers as well as the programs the job executes are physically stored in processor storageCS,ES, or AUX). A H/S exists in either ES or AUX, or both. Normal MVS hierarchy of storage dictates that AUX i",p303-24.pdf
"Abstract When running SAS ® programs on a PC, the user needs only to worry about how much free space there is on the PC they are using. However, when SAS programs are run under MVS on a mainframe machine, the correct use of disk space for WORK and permanent SAS Data Libraries is more complex, but essential to their smooth running. This paper describes various methods of exploiting the space available on a mainframe. Introduction To demonstrate the similarities and differences between PC SAS and MVS mainframe SAS Systems I will include a quick comparison of PC and MVS mainframe terms here: Tape, e.g. 2Gb (1000's) DAT, e.g. 4Gb (10's) DASD, or disk volume, e.g. 2.5Gb (100's, or more) Hard drive, e.g. 3.2Gb (10's, or less) Region, e.g. 8Mb (100's of users) RAM, e.g. 64Mb (1 user) MVS mainframe  PC Unlike other platforms for SAS software, when you create a file under MVS, you must specify the initial and maximum amounts of disk space you require, in advance. If this is not done correctly, then, either the file will run out of space prematurely, if you specify too small an amount, or the file will not be created at all, if you specify an initial size which is bigger than the free space on any of the available disk volumes. Space Allocation under MVS Space allocations under MVS are made up of 2 distinct parts: Primary allocation determines how big the file will be when it is first created, and, hence, determines which disk volume it will be created on, i.e. one which has free space big enough to receive the new file. It should be noted that the initial space allocation can be satisfied using up to 4 separate pieces, called 'extents'. If more than 4 extents would be required to complete the Primary allocation, then the creation fails. Secondary allocations, or extents, are used when the file has additional data written into it, so that the original allocation is not big enough to hold all the data. Up to a total of 16 extents, including the Primary allocation, can be creat",p304-24.pdf
"Paper 305 Ways of Learning: What the Trainer and the Student Need to Know about Learning Styles by Judy Loren, L. L. Bean Introduction What is the best method for training? What media are most effective in accomplishing the trainers goals? The learners goals? How does a manager spend a training budget effectively? Knowing the subject matter of the training will not answer these questions. Choosing a training path that will be effective requires an understanding of the learning style of the student. Understanding learning styles benefits the learner, who can choose training paths that are most likely to succeed; the trainer, who can vary presentations to reach a diverse set of learners; and the training administrator, who can choose courses that include all learners in their audience. This paper will review several proposed systems for categorizing learning styles and suggest specific training techniques that will broaden the accessibility of training courses to all learners. It will touch on ways to identify your own learning style, or your own teaching style, and provide information on how to adapt to styles that are different from yours. What is Learning Style? People seem to be born with clear preferences for certain ways of interacting with their environment, and for ways of processing information internally. Environment can play a role in strengthening these preferences or building up the effectiveness of the less preferred method. The combination of these preferences can be thought of as the individuals learning style. Learning involves taking information from the environment and processing it internally so that it can become part of the individuals repertoire. In a very broad sense, the goal of learning is for the individual to own a concept or tool, being able to use it effectively to increase her ability to pursue and reach her goals. Research is showing that matching teaching methods with the students preferred learning style increases the chances f",p305-24.pdf
"n that says managing technical people is like herding cats. Cant you picture it - SAS developers are typically quite technical and creative people who each have a unique way of using software to solve the same problem. They dont need to be managed; they need to be free to do problem solving without confining boundaries. After all, isnt that the beauty of SAS software? Yes, of course it is. Then how can one suggest using project management principles, which strive for definition and planning, in the creative SAS software development environment? Applying project management in a SAS software development environment is unique. It requires a different breed of project management that considers large project teams, a fast pace, a creative culture, and an ever-changing development environment. This new breed of project management is what I affectionately call SPAM (Sarahs Project Anti Management). Dont be alarmed by the word anti; it does not mean that traditional project management is not appropriate.

"step forward for SAS Institute and is the first release of a new generation of SAS ® software. Customers confronted with a new generation of software are concerned about the cost of moving their applications to that new release and are reluctant to move everything at once. This paper reviews some of the reasons why customers want to move some or all of their applications to Version 7.  We recognize that many sites will not want to move everything forward at the same time; therefore, this paper discusses techniques to make partial migrations (mixing Version 6 and Version 7 applications) and techniques for running critical systems in parallel (to facilitate comparing Version 6 to 7). Maintaining data libraries in the proper format (Version 6 versus 7) and cross version compatibility issues in a client/server environment are two of the concerns addressed. Why Convert to Version 7? Version 7 contains a number of features that were beyond the scope of Version 6.  These are features that required major re-writes of the SAS system. The new Version 7 features provide the major motivation for moving to Version 7. While this paper does not go into detail about these features, the following is a list of the author's favorite new features: 1.

INTRODUCTION THE INTERNET - WHAT IS IT? AND WHERE DID IT COME FROM? The Internet simply put, is a vast network of computers that spans the globe. Vast seems to be an understatement when describing the Internet, in that there are estimated to be 20 to 30 million users around the world populating this electronic global village. 1   Estimates by the computer industry are that World Wide Web traffic is growing at an annual rate of 341,000% and is being used by 159 countries around the globe. 2 HISTORY OF THE INTERNET In the early 1960's a group of scientists at the US Department of Defense's Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA) wanted to see if computers in different locations could be linked to develop an efficient way of sharing information. Initially the goal was not the creation of what we know today as the Internet, but rather simply a data network that could survive a nuclear attack. ARPAnet was launched when it was discovered that networking could link large research computers to each other. Use of ARPAnet grew throughout research organizations and major universities. In 1969 private industry joined the network of computers and CompuServe was launched as the 1st commercially available online service. In 1986 the National Science Foundation created NSFnet to connect supercomputers around the United States and within two years this network replaced ARPAnet. In the 1990s the Internet has grown at exponential rates. Vice-President Al Gore proposed to offer access to students in kindergarten through grade 12 in 1991. The Internet has continued in unparalleled growth. Over the years it has become the most widely used information retrieval system, giving access to a global network of multimedia resources to anyone with a computer.

It will show how to develop a FRAME using list boxes to define the subsets and show the passing of SCL list information to the SAS/EIS® software Multidimensional Report via a method override. Skill Level: Advanced programmers INTRODUCTION In recent years, a new reporting tool for business decision support has evolved. The multidimensional data base is a storage technique that allows summarized data to be stored by hierarchies (classified by ranking order). This storage method has allowed businesses to quickly query the data using graphical interface software. This software allows drilling down/up in the predefined hierarchies. The SAS/EIS® software product provides both MDDB table creation and multidimensional reporting ability. PROBLEM When using SAS/MDDB and SAS/EIS® software version 6.12, it is possible to quickly build a MDDB and a multidimensional report. The biggest problem is reporting too much data; data that is not appropriate or needed. One question that arises when building the MDDB and the reports is how many MDDBs should be created. My approach was to keep everything as simple as possible by developing only one MDDB per logical data grouping and not by hierarchy. I was cons",p33-24.pdf

"TAP is an acronym for Table Acquisition Program which enables users to select from a list of programs, various summary tables and listings they would like to produce for a report. The application begins by displaying a FRAME which enables the user to select a clinical trial (database) from which the data will be summarized. Once the trial is selected, the next FRAME appears which provides the selection list of programs. In addition to producing tables from this frame, selected tables may be viewed on the screen and/or sent to the printer. Except for the selection of a study and the production of the selected tables, there is virtually no SCL code. From this application, additional functionality can be added such as screens that would enable the user to control the display of the tables including table numbers, titles, footnotes, special sub-setting of the data, etc. The FRAME entries, objects, and SCL code described in this paper can open the door to a wide variety of easy to use point and click applications.",p35-24.pdf
"Using SAS/AF as part of the quality assurance process in reviewing SAS data sets during a statistical analysis provides a quick solution to resolving data queries. A Graphical User Interactive (GUI) module based on a Data Table Object provides a convenient way to examine a SAS data set by pointing and clicking. The Data Table Class in SAS/AF with Screen Control Language (SCL) programming is very powerful in manipulating the way to browse SAS data sets. The example module called Data Display allows the user to browse data sets located on local disks or remote platforms such as Unix. The user can choose a data set to be viewed from a specified data library. The chosen data set is displayed by Data Table Object in a tabular format with multiple rows, in full size or a drill down subset by a value of a variable. This module consists of the following widgets: DATA TABLE, CONTROL, RADIO BOX, LIST BOX, and a few PUSH BUTTONs.   Each of the widgets is supported by a labeled SCL programming section. It requires software SAS 6.12, SAS/AF, and SAS/CONNECT to run this module.",p36-24.pdf

"So You're Running Out of Sort Work Space . . . Reducing the Resources Used by PROC SORT Bob Virgile Robert Virgile Associates, Inc. Overview If you're concerned about the storage space used by PROC SORT, there may be hope. The SAS software contains tools and strategies that reduce or trade off the resources needed to sort data. This tutorial explains these tools, with an emphasis on reducing the amount of sort work space. Therefore most of this paper applies specifically to the MVS environment. The Basics of Sort Work Space When the SAS ® software runs PROC SORT, the operating environment reserves storage space to perform the sorting. Unlike under other operating systems, under MVS this space remains separate from the WORK area. If you run out of sort work space, increasing the WORK area (or deleting data sets which are no longer needed) will not help. Sort work space also has physical characteristics which differ from the WORK area. This would be a typical DD statement used by the SAS procedure to define a sort work area: //SORTWK01 DD UNIT=SYSDA, //         SPACE=(CYL,(&SORT),,CONTIG) This JCL points out two key features of each sort work area:     ! it occupies a contiguous block of space, and     ! its size (&SORT) is a parameter that the programmer can pass to the operating system when submitting a job SAS programmers can adjust two numbers to expand the total amount of sort work space:     ! the size of each sort work area, and     ! the maximum number of sort work areas created by the program. Specify the &SORT parameter to adjust the size of each sort work area: // EXEC SAS,SORT=8 Using this EXEC statement, the job would now reserve 8 cylinders for each sort work area. Limit the number of sort work areas in the SAS code, not the JCL, either as a global option or as a PROC SORT option: options SORTWKNO=3; proc sort data=sales SORTWKNO=5; This option determines the maximum number of sort work areas that PROC SORT is allowed to use. These steps are effective as",p39-24.pdf
"A Report Writing Seminar given at Westat was charged with finding new techniques to control complex DATA _NULL_ reports. This paper presents one of the techniques developed. DATA _NULL_ reports often require numerous tedious conditional PUT statements writing a mixture of literal information with data. In such cases one can view the report as a text input file with variable references, where one wants to conditionally print certain lines after making substitutions for variable references and conditionally inserting lines which are not in the input text file. This approach dramatically changes the way one can look at some DATA _NULL_ reporting problems. A macro, COPYREPL, is used to generate DATA step code which automates the replacement of variable references with their values in a manner reminiscent of a mail-merge program. However, one quickly discovers the need to develop various control procedures to enhance the use of this macro. The talk will consist of presenting several examples ranging from simple to complex using this technique, concentrating on how to implement the control procedures required to use the macro in complex situations, and the macro.",p40-24.pdf
"Many computer tasks are controlled and modified by parameters. They convey to our tasks information such as what range of dates to include, which reports to run, where to find the raw data, and sometimes whether an error has occurred that should cause suspension of the requested task. Parameters are one of the main means for tying tasks together to form applications. When using SAS/AF ® 1 and SCL, parameters can be passed along with CALL statements, through SCL Lists and SLIST catalog entries, parameter data sets and files, and through macro variables. This paper will explore and contrast examples of these techniques. Strategies to choose the best means for passing parameters to different types of successor tasks will be offered. When tasks are launched by a web server or a production scheduler, additional problems may emerge. How can we anticipate and accommodate changes in the computing environment between when a task is scheduled or requested, and when the task starts to run? Strategies to make server and scheduler launched tasks more robust will be shared.",p41-24.pdf
"Paper 42 How to Use Version 7 Features to Optimize the Distributed Capabilities of SAS® Software Cheryl Garner, SAS Institute, Inc. Introduction This paper introduces several new Version 7 SAS/CONNECT® capabilities designed to facilitate and secure distributed processing. The features covered in this paper include:  asynchronous compute services  cross-environment data access (CEDA)  messaging services  remote objecting services  agent services  encryption services Asynchronous compute services allow you to initiate a remote submit and immediately regain control in the local SAS® session to continue processing. CEDA enables direct processing of SAS data files across multiple platforms. Messaging capabilities provide both direct and indirect messaging to facilitate the development of multi-tiered distributed applications and applications that can communicate independently of time, logic flow, and location. Remote objecting provides application developers the ability to distribute objects in their applications across hardware platforms. Agent services allow both scheduled and dynamic execution of SAS source code containing built-in conditional logic to run across your network. And, encryption services provide privacy of your data as it is sent across the network. Asynchronous Compute Services Compute services give you easy access to many of the remote resources on your network from a single local SAS session. SAS/CONNECT provides access to remote resources in two forms, synchronous and asynchronous. With synchronous processing, the default behavior, you wait for the results of the remote processing before you are able to continue local processing. With asynchronous processing, you immediately regain control to continue local processing while the remote job executes. Results can be obtained at a later time. The ability to execute remote submits asynchronously allows you to continue processing on your local host while the remote submit processes in the background.",p42-24.pdf

"Indexing and Compressing SAS ® Data Sets: How, Why, and Why Not Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. San Francisco, California USA Many users of SAS System software, especially those working with large data sets, are often confronted with two challenges: a) how can the data set be made smaller, without deleting important variables and/or observations? and, b) can the time required to retrieve subsets of these observations be reduced? Recent releases of the SAS System contains tools which address both of these problems, and this paper discusses how they can be used appropriately to accomplish the desired results. The paper also suggests instances where either compression or indexing are not the appropriate steps to take. At the outset, it should be understood that compression and indexing SAS data sets are two separate concepts. At times it is appropriate to apply an index to a data set, but not compress it, or vice versa. In many instances, as will be discussed below, inappropriate application of one or both of these tools to a SAS data set may have results contrary to those desired. As we will see, it is possible to increase the size of a data set by use of data set compression tools. It is also possible to increase the amount of computing resources (e.g., time) required to find observations in a data set if an index is applied improperly. This paper will hopefully explain when each tool is potentially appropriate and demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks from both. Part One: Data Set Compression A SAS data set contains three (and, perhaps, four, see below) parts: descriptor portion, variables and observations. The descriptor portion serves as the header or roadmap to the data set, and tells the SAS System supervisor where the variables are located. It also contains information such as when the data set was created, the number of observations and variables, if it has been sorted (and by which variables), the variable labels and the names of for",p45-24.pdf

Merging on names with approximately the same spelling, or merging on times that are within three minutes of each other are examples of these kinds of merges. These merges are often called fuzzy merges. This tutorial examines the realm of fuzzy merges. It looks at relevant techniques and gives examples of actual programs which produce fuzzy merges. INTRODUCTION     Fuzzy merges appear in the real world quite often. They come in all shapes, sizes and disguises.     This paper examines four such merges. First, it looks into a merge on approximate times. Then, it explores a merge on the most recent occurrence by date. Finally, it delves into phonetic merging and merging on names. This article is for anyone who has at least one year of SAS BASE experience and is familiar with match- merging. On finishing this paper, you will have seen many fuzzy-merge techniques and should have a basic understand of how fuzzy merges work. MERGING     File merging, in computing, has been around for a long time. In fact, it was around in 1888 when Herman Hollerith invented computer cards (also know as IBM cards or Hollerith cards).     Merging is an operation performed on two or more files, sorted in a given order, to create a single file in the same order. There are many types of merges. There are merges involving computer cards and electronic files. There are one-to-one merges, match-merges, and fuzzymerges. In fact,",p46-24.pdf

"Transforming SAS ® Data Sets Using Arrays Ronald Cody, Ed.D., Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ Introduction This paper describes how to efficiently transform SAS data sets using arrays. First, let us discuss what we mean by the term ""transforming."" You may want to create multiple observations from a single observation or vice versa. There are several possible reasons why you may want to do this. You may want to create multiple observations from a single observation to count frequencies or to allow for BY variable processing. You may also want to restructure SAS data sets for certain statistical analyses. Creating a single observation from multiple observations may make it easier for you to compute differences between variables without resorting to LAG functions or to use the REPEATED statement in PROC GLM. PROC TRANSFORM may come to mind as a solution to these transforming problems, but using arrays in a Data Step can be more flexible and allow you to have full control over the transformation process. Example 1: Creating a New Data Set with Several Observations per Subject from a Data Set with One Observation per Subject Suppose you have a data set called DIAGNOSE, with the variables ID, DX1, DX2, and DX3. The DXn variables represent three diagnosis codes. The observations in data set DIAGNOSE are: DATA SET DIAGNOSE ID DX1 DX2 DX3 01 3 4 02 1 2 3 03 4 5 04 7 As you can see, some subjects have only one diagnosis code, some two, and some, all three. Suppose you want to count how many subjects have diagnosis 1, how many have diagnosis 2, and so on. You don't care if the diagnosis code is listed as DX1, DX2, or DX3. In the example here, you would have a frequency of one for diagnosis codes 1, 2, 5, and 7 and a frequency of two for diagnosis codes 3 and 4. One way to accomplish this task is to transform the data set DIAGNOSE which has one observation per subject and three diagnosis variables, to a data set that has a single diagnosis variable and as man",p48-24.pdf
"A logical data model should do more than help a DBA protect the integrity of a database; it should also make life easier for programmers. A scheme such as that displayed in a simple E-R diagram can serve as a map that a programmer can use to navigate through a database. Primary and foreign keys can represent different entities and their interactions in the real world. Integrity constraints built into a database can guarantee that normal updates will not invalidate a correct program. This presentation looks at database design from the point of view of a programmer. It begins with examples of alternative database schemes and how they can make programming harder or easier. Following a brief overview of the concepts of relations and dimensions, the emphasis shifts to more complex database schemes and methods. Examples include databased links among locations, persons, laboratory specimens, and clinical events, and among vendors, clients, and sales.

"nt describes three performance improvements made to PROC SQL for Version 7 of the SAS System. These improvements are:  development of an implicit, or automatic, form of PassThrough to enable better execution of PROC SQL queries that referenced one or more data sets via SAS/ACCESS ® software,  enabling any WHERE clause specified by a procedure statement to be pushed down into a view referenced in the DATA= option of that procedure, and  making the most common use of an alias much less expensive. IMPLICIT PASSTHROUGH Implicit PassThrough (IP) is the result of a collaborative effort between the PROC SQL and SAS/ACCESS groups. The goal of this effort is to provide you with an automatic and implicit mechanism that provides many of the benefits of the PassThrough facility in PROC SQL when your PROC SQL query references one or more DBMS tables associated with a single libname engine. These benefits will occur without any need for you to use any special syntax or even be aware that DBMS tables are involved in the query  PROC SQL will simply take care of matters behind the scene, so to speak. This new mechanism is intended to complement, rather than replace, the existing PassThrough mechanism. There is still very much a need for PassThrough, e.g., you may want to ask the DBMS to do a natural join. PROC SQL wont support natural join syntax until Version 9. In the meantime, you will need to use PassThrough in order to get the syntax past the PROC SQL parser. Before delving more int",p51-24.pdf
"lick way to extract data from a table. With very little instruction, you can create an SQL program to gather data, manipulate it and create reports. Does it have limitations? The answer to that is yes. Is there a work around for those limitations? The answer is also yes. This paper will explore what some of those limitations are in the query window and how to program around them. INTRODUCTION The SQL Query Window is an interactive application. It simplifies the process of building and executing an SQL Query. Data that is stored in SAS ® data sets, SAS views, VSAM files, Database Management Systems (DBMS) supported by SAS/ACCESS ® software, or any data the SAS System can access are accessible through the Query Window. Without being familiar with SQL or the SAS SQL procedure, you can build, save and run queries. You can run a report of your query, save your query as a catalog query entry to include later, save your query as a catalog source entry, save your query to an external file, or save your query results as an SQL table (SAS data set) or SQL view. In order to build a query, you must choose what actions you want to be performed on the data. The difference here is that you are doing it all in a point and click environment and then have the ability to save the code for changes that you would like to make in the future.

"W ORKING W ITH SAS ® D ATE AND T IME F UNCTIONS Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. San Francisco, California USA Introduction Many SAS ® applications require that operations be performed on data collected in the time domain. Among these types of operations are:  determining the frequency that a phenomenon of interest occurs in time  determining the a time interval which has elapsed between two phenomena (e.g., length of stay between admission and discharge from the hospital)  conditional operations on observations in a SAS data set based on date and/or time values (e.g., select from a SAS data set only those observations which occurred after a particular point in time).  aggregation of observations from one time frequency to another (e.g., daily to monthly)  interpolation (i.e., estimation) of lower frequency observations from data collected at a higher frequency (e.g., estimating monthly values from data collected quarterly) The SAS System Software provides a wealth of tools for users who need to work with data collected in the time domain. These tools include functions which:  create a SAS date, time or datetime variable from either raw data or from variables in an existing SAS data set  determine the interval between two periods  declare a SAS date or time variable as a constant  extract parts from a SAS date variable, such as the month, day or week, or year A second set of tools, SAS date/time formats, modify the external representation of a SAS date or time variable. As with other SAS System formats, a date, time or datetime format displays the values of the variable according to a specified width and form. Use of date, time or datetime formats is essential when creating applications or programs in the SAS System portraying the values of variables collected in time.

"How and When to Use WHERE J. Meimei Ma, Quintiles, Research Triangle Park, NC Sandra Schlotzhauer, Schlotzhauer Consulting, Chapel Hill, NC INTRODUCTION This tutorial explores the various types of WHERE as methods for creating or operating on subsets. The discussion covers DATA steps, Procedures, and basic use of WHERE clauses in the SQL procedure. Topics range from basic syntax to efficiencies when accessing large indexed data sets. The intent is to start answering the questions:  What is WHERE?  How do you use WHERE?  Why is WHERE sometimes more efficient?  When is WHERE appropriate? The primary audience for this presentation includes programmers, statisticians, data managers, and other people who often need to process subsets. Only basic knowledge of the SAS system is assumed, in particular no experience beyond Base SAS is expected. However, people with more experience may still discover new reasons for using WHERE as well as potential pitfalls. The simple examples provided to show syntax and potential complications apply to all operating systems running Release 6.08 or later. TERMINOLOGY Efficiency Elements There are two primary categories of elements to consider when evaluating efficiency: machine and human. Machine efficiency elements include computer processing time, often called CPU, and processing time for reading or writing computer data, called I/O for Input/Output. Efficiency for humans is measured by considering programmer time, level of expertise required, or clarity of final code. Major components of programmer time include planning programming strategy, writing new code, testing programs, running production programs, and revising existing code. Always consider both machine and human elements when choosing between options for efficiency reasons. The choice may be difficult, or at least ambiguous, since the more machine efficient option can require additional human effort or vice-versa.

"Changing the Shape of Your Data: PROC TRANSPOSE vs. Arrays Bob Virgile Robert Virgile Associates, Inc. Overview To transpose your data (turning variables into observations or turning observations into variables), you can use either PROC TRANSPOSE or array processing within a DATA step. This tutorial examines basic variations on both methods, comparing features and advantages of each. A Simple Transposition Let's begin the analysis by examining a simple situation, where the program should transpose observations into variables. In the original data, each person has 3 observations. In the final version, each person should have just one observation. In the ""before"" picture, the data are already sorted BY NAME DATE:   NAME DATE    Amy Date #A1    Amy Date #A2    Amy Date #A3    Bob Date #B1    Bob Date #B2    Bob Date #B3 In the ""after"" picture, the data will still be sorted by NAME:   NAME     DATE1        DATE2       DATE3    Amy     Date #A1    Date #A2    Date #A3    Bob       Date #B1     Date #B2    Date #B3 The PROC TRANSPOSE program is short and sweet:   PROC TRANSPOSE DATA=OLD OUT=NEW        PREFIX=DATE;        VAR DATE;        BY NAME; The PREFIX= option controls the names for the transposed variables (DATE1, DATE2, etc.) Without it, the names of the new variables would be COL1, COL2, etc. Actually, PROC TRANSPOSE creates an extra variable, _NAME_, indicating the name of the transposed variable. _NAME_ has a value of DATE on both observations. To eliminate the extra variable, modify a portion of the PROC statement:   OUT=NEW (DROP=_NAME_) The equivalent DATA step code using arrays could be:   DATA NEW (KEEP=NAME DATE1-DATE3);   SET OLD;   BY NAME;   ARRAY DATES {3} DATE1-DATE3;   RETAIN DATE1-DATE3;   IF FIRST.NAME THEN I=1;   ELSE I + 1;   DATES{I} = DATE;   IF LAST.NAME; This program assumes that each NAME has exactly three observations.

But odds are that no matter how you organize and analyze your data, youll end up producing a report in the form of a table. This is why every SAS user needs to know how to use PROC TABULATE. While TABULATE doesnt do anything that you cant do with other PROCs, the payoff is in the output. TABULATE computes a variety of statistics, and it neatly packages the results in a single table. Unfortunately, TABULATE has gotten a bad rap as being a difficult procedure to learn. This paper will prove that if you take things step by step, anyone can learn PROC TABULATE. I NTRODUCTION This paper will start out with the most basic onedimensional table. We will then go on to two-dimensional tables, tables with totals, and finally, three-dimensional tables. By the end of this paper, you will be ready to build most basic TABULATE tables. O NE - DIMENSIONAL TABLES To really understand TABULATE, you have to start very simply. The simplest possible table in TABULATE has to have three things: a PROC TABULATE statement, a TABLE statement, and a CLASS or VAR statement. In this example, we will use a VAR statement. Later examples will show the CLASS statement. The PROC TABULATE statement looks like this: 352&*7$%8/$7(*'$7$ 7(03* The second part of the procedure is the TABLE statement.

"The macro language is a powerful tool, but it can be dangerous in the hands of the naive. This tutorial takes the first steps in building a strong foundation to understanding of the SAS macro facility. Macro variables are introduced as parameters to a SAS program. Then %INCLUDE is added, and the power of this combination demonstrated. Macros are introduced as a better means of packaging code, and the consequences are explored with examples. Design issues and understanding are emphasized. The consequences of adding the DATA step functions CALL SYMPUT and CALL EXECUTE to the programmer's repertoire are considered. As an extension, very simple PROC SQL code is introduced to make macro variables holding lists. The power of this new tool is demonstrated with examples. If you restrict the use of macro to the above tools you have a dramatically more powerful language than SAS alone provides, and debugging is no harder than without these tools. In this way you are prepared to step into the world of SAS macro with the appropriate confidence that you are the master of the language and not vice versa.",p63-24.pdf

PROC SQL can be used to retrieve, update, and report on information from SAS data sets or other database products. This paper will concentrate on SQL's syntax and how to access information from existing SAS data sets. Some of the topics covered include: Write SQL code using various styles of the SELECT statement. Dynamically create new variables on the SELECT statement. Use SQL options to control the appearance of reports. Create multiple reports with a single PROC SQL statement. Create reports containing percentages using PROC SQL. Use CASE/WHEN clauses for conditionally processing the data. Joining data from two or more data sets (like a MERGE!). Why Learn PROC SQL? PROC SQL can not only retrieve information without having to learn SAS syntax, but it can often do this with fewer and shorter statements than traditional SAS code. Additionally, on average it uses fewer resources than conventional DATA and PROC steps. This means PROC SQL can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. Further, the knowledge learned is transferrable to other SQL packages. An Example of PROC SQL's Syntax Every PROC SQL must have at least one SELECT statement. The purpose of the SELECT statement is to name the columns that will appear on the report and the order in which they will appear (similar to a VAR statement on PROC PRINT)",p66-24.pdf
"The SAS ® Debugging Primer Frank C. DiIorio Advanced Integrated Manufacturing Solutions, Co. Chapel Hill NC Weve all been there. Indeed, sometimes it seems we live there. We take a functioning program, make some changes, rerun it and  are thrust into the Land of Bad Code. What happened? Why did the seemingly minor change wreak such havoc? Most important  how do you fix the program? This paper discusses a variety of SAS debugging techniques. It  addresses background, behavioral issues related to program development  identifies some common errors and possible remedies  describes in necessarily broad terms the tools SAS provides to make debugging a relatively painless process. The text and examples are limited to Base SAS. Consider, however, that even though other products such as SAS.AF and SAS/IML have their own programming environments and syntax, the program process is in many ways identical. Much of what is discussed here can be fruitfully applied elsewhere in the SAS System. Finally, the paper implicitly emphasizes the importance of good coding style. Indeed, if the code is written well there will be much less opportunity for using debugging techniques. Write clearly, avoid tricks, consider all possible logic paths, and you will see most of your programming time being dedicated to development and not debugging. For an excellent book dealing with programming style see Steve McConnells Code Complete. BEHAVIORAL ISSUES (YOU) Your attitude is as important as the tools and techniques you will be using when fixing a program.

The user now expects to see a very graphical (GUI) look in everything they use, word processors, graphics packages, databases and statistical applications. Since 1991, SAS/AF software has been developed to be increasingly graphical and extremely functional, and is the basis for many enhancements to SAS software itself, such as the Analyst Application, SAS/Warehouse AdminstratorTM and Enterprise MinerTM software.

"In the real world, most data are not stored in SAS data sets. Typical data repositories used by business and academia include legacy mainframe files, client/server relational database management systems, and simple text files on desktop computers. While we want to use SAS to examine, to analyze, to display, and to graph this data, SAS works best with data stored in SAS data sets, not with data stored in their native forms. Fortunately, SAS has very powerful tools for reading a wide variety of external files, from the most rudimentary to the most complex. This paper is an updated and expanded version of similar papers presented by the author at previous SAS conferences and will introduce DATA step techniques for reading standard external files not stored in data base management systems or proprietary file structures. We will begin with a brief overview of what to do before writing any code, followed by an examination of the SAS statements used to read an external file. Starting with very simple files, we will study programs that utilize more complicated features, including reading into arrays, multiple format files, variable length files, and multiple record files.",p70-24.pdf

Describe an application or data set. Present simple efficiency techniques for the application or data set. This approach is designed to make it easier for SAS software users to determine when to apply the techniques to their application or data set.

"Transforming SAS ® Data Sets Using Arrays Ronald Cody, Ed.D., Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ Introduction This paper describes how to efficiently transform SAS data sets using arrays. First, let us discuss what we mean by the term ""transforming."" You may want to create multiple observations from a single observation or vice versa. There are several possible reasons why you may want to do this. You may want to create multiple observations from a single observation to count frequencies or to allow for BY variable processing. You may also want to restructure SAS data sets for certain statistical analyses. Creating a single observation from multiple observations may make it easier for you to compute differences between variables without resorting to LAG functions or to use the REPEATED statement in PROC GLM. PROC TRANSFORM may come to mind as a solution to these transforming problems, but using arrays in a Data Step can be more flexible and allow you to have full control over the transformation process. Example 1: Creating a New Data Set with Several Observations per Subject from a Data Set with One Observation per Subject Suppose you have a data set called DIAGNOSE, with the variables ID, DX1, DX2, and DX3. The DXn variables represent three diagnosis codes. The observations in data set DIAGNOSE are: DATA SET DIAGNOSE ID DX1 DX2 DX3 01 3 4 02 1 2 3 03 4 5 04 7 As you can see, some subjects have only one diagnosis code, some two, and some, all three. Suppose you want to count how many subjects have diagnosis 1, how many have diagnosis 2, and so on. You don't care if the diagnosis code is listed as DX1, DX2, or DX3. In the example here, you would have a frequency of one for diagnosis codes 1, 2, 5, and 7 and a frequency of two for diagnosis codes 3 and 4. One way to accomplish this task is to transform the data set DIAGNOSE which has one observation per subject and three diagnosis variables, to a data set that has a single diagnosis variable and as man",25p001.pdf

Although I emphasize concepts, I also include syntax, examples, and applications. INTRODUCTION Since this is an advanced tutorial, I assume that you already know how to2:  create temporary and permanent value formats using the FORMAT procedure and the special keywords LOW, HIGH, and OTHER  use FORMAT, INFORMAT, and ATTRIB statements, and PUT and INPUT functions  maintain user-defined formats by modifying source code or via control data sets  apply formats and informats to tasks such as reading external data, decoding, validation, collapsing data, type conversion, and table lookup.

In mathematics, a function is a type of mapping. Its domain is defined as the set of all valid input values to be mapped, and its range is the set of all valid output values3.  For example, if the domain of the function f(x) = x2 is defined as all real numbers, then its range is all real numbers 0. A function is constrained so that any valu",25p002.pdf

"ferences are in how they are used and applied. While DATA step functions are applied to values on the Program Data Vector, PDV, macro functions are used to create, modify, and work with text strings. Initially this may seem like a minor difference, but because macro functions deal with text, they can be used to build SAS code. This becomes the powerful advantage of the macro language. The use of various macro functions will be presented. Some of these functions return quoted results, and macro quoting functions will be introduced. Examples will include functions like %SYSEVALF and %SYSFUNC, which are new to V6.11 and V6.12, as well as, various Autocall macros. Several of the examples are adapted from  Carpenters Complete Guide to the SAS Macro ® Language .  KEYWORDS MACRO, MACRO FUNCTIONS, %SYSFUNC, MACRO QUOTING, SCL MACRO CHARACTER FUNCTIONS Macro character functions either change or provide information about the text string that is included as one of the arguments.

"Indexing and Compressing SAS ® Data Sets: How, Why, and Why Not Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. San Francisco, California USA Many users of SAS System software, especially those working with large data sets, are often confronted with two challenges: a) how can the data set be made smaller, without deleting important variables and/or observations? and, b) can the time required to retrieve subsets of these observations be reduced? Recent releases of the SAS System contains tools which address both of these problems, and this paper discusses how they can be used appropriately to accomplish the desired results. The paper also suggests instances where either compression or indexing are not the appropriate steps to take. At the outset, it should be understood that compression and indexing SAS data sets are two separate concepts. At times it is appropriate to apply an index to a data set, but not compress it, or vice versa. In many instances, as will be discussed below, inappropriate application of one or both of these tools to a SAS data set may have results contrary to those desired. As we will see, it is possible to increase the size of a data set by use of data set compression tools. It is also possible to increase the amount of computing resources (e.g., time) required to find observations in a data set if an index is applied improperly. This paper will hopefully explain when each tool is potentially appropriate and demonstrate the benefits and drawbacks from both. Part One: Data Set Compression A SAS data set contains three (and, perhaps, four, see below) parts: descriptor portion, variables and observations. The descriptor portion serves as the header or roadmap to the data set, and tells the SAS System supervisor where the variables are located. It also contains information such as when the data set was created, the number of observations and variables, if it has been sorted (and by which variables), the variable labels and the names of for",25p005.pdf

Dilbert reported that when he computed the total time spent waiting for web pages to load, he found that it wiped out all the productivity gains of the Information Age. This is a tutorial about design of data presentation for effective communication. It covers concepts, examples, and innovations for making best use of those precious resources: the time and attention of your information recipients/users, and your own time and effort to package and deliver information. The tutorial shows how to emphasize, order, rank, and subset/limit information, how to handle the viewer's concerns when presenting partial information, and how to supplement the big picture with details. The ideas presented are technology-independent.

"Paper 16-25 Multiprocessing with Version 8 of the SAS * * * * System Cheryl Garner, SAS Institute, Inc. INTRODUCTION With the ever increasing need to get more done in the same amount of time, naturally we would want our computer applications to take advantage of the multi-processors available in many of todays desktop and server platforms. By dividing time-consuming tasks into multiple independent units of work and executing these independent units of work in parallel, a job can be performed in substantially less time than if each task is performed sequentially. A new feature has been added to Version 8 of the SAS® System that allows your SAS jobs to take advantage of MP and SMP hardware. This feature is part of the SAS/CONNECT® product and is called MP CONNECT. MP CONNECT allows you to perform disjoint units of work in parallel and coordinate all results into your original SAS session for the purpose of reducing the total elapsed time necessary to execute a particular application. This paper will introduce the concept of multiprocessing and illustrate its benefits. Benchmarks will be presented to show tangible proof of the time savings that are possible by modifying your existing jobs as well as designing new jobs to use MP CONNECT for multiprocessing.  The syntax and options that enable MP CONNECT will be covered. And finally, the test case that was used to collect the benchmarks presented in this paper will be included in an appendix. WHY MULTIPROCESSING The primary purpose of multi- or parallel processing is to complete a job in less total elapsed time than it would take to execute the same job serially. With this capability IT staffs are challenged to have their applications take advantage of the multiple processors available in todays server platforms. However, generally, the SAS System is a single-threaded application that executes on a single processor. Independent parallelism is possible when the execution of Task A and Task B do not have any interdepende",25p016.pdf
"The SAS Web Publishing Tools ( %TAB2HTM , %DS2HTM and %OUT2HTM ) can be used to create HTML pages for publishing on the Internet or an Intranet.

( %OUT2HTM can be used to add titling and other information to any SAS procedure output, but the basic procedure output is not really enhanced.)   By using simple SAS MACRO processing combined with the manipulation of TITLE statements, basic data set variable values and values of variables used as CLASS variables in TABULATE procedures, you can create whole systems of hot-linked pages with almost full drill-down capabilities. The technique is to simply insert (via macros or DATA step coding) the desired navigational HTML tags, in the appropriate places, to the to-be-displayed data (or TITLE ) values, before running the data set through %DS2HTM , or through the TABULATE procedure to be used with %TAB2HTM .   Techniques and examples are shown in this paper.",25p017.pdf

That ease of use, however, combined with the power of the SAS System, has quickly led us to generate large volumes of HTML output for information delivery to business partners. What we soon needed was a way to quickly identify and highlight particular data cells, rows, columns and entire tables - and we needed a way to make it data-driven. The solution we arrived at puts a new twist on a very old technique - reading in an output file and post-processing to customize the output. Even though it uses an old tried-andtrue technique, it remains a valuable tool in the SAS toolkit. I learn best by example, so well walk though the steps to add highlighting to your SAS HTML output.

"ntation: Web and non-Web Environments John Laing, SAS Institute (Canada) Inc., Toronto, ON ABSTRACT Client/server setup is becoming more and more challenging. This presentation provides some practical guidelines when using SAS® software in a client/server environment. INTRODUCTION Client/server requirements are driven by a number of factors:  Large data warehouses, distributed data marts, knowledge warehouses.  Mergers/acquisitions consolidating some staff and facilities, while distributing others.  The web used for both information delivery and analysis. Design issues include  Thin or fat client?  Web-based?  Processing requirements of client.  What kind of users?  Security * data and applications. * internal or external users?  Automation * push or pull? OVERVIEW Client/server applications involve co-operative processing among 2 or more computers.  The client is a process that makes a request for a service.  The server is a process that fulfils the request from the client.  The network is the medium used to transmit the requests and the results. Applications can be thought of as a series of functional components. This is not news - remember HIPO charts? Consider an application to be made up of three basic functions: In a single-platform application, all components execute on the same computer. In a client/server application, you can choose among multiple computers for each functional component: To design a flexible client/server application, you need to  exec",25p019.pdf
"Introduction In recent years, the use of mixed models in fitting data in the biomedical sciences, social sciences, economics, and business, has become more widespread. Part of the increase in the use of such models, apart from their inherent utility, is because software to fit such models has become increasingly available. SAS Institutes contribution to the mixed model software is PROC MIXED. However, because mixed models are more complex and more flexible than the general linear model, the potential for confusion and errors is higher. This paper outlines some confusion that may occur when data analysts experienced in the use PROC GLM to analyze data for both the fixed-effects and mixed-effects models use PROC MIXED to analyze data. Littell, Milliken, Stroup, and Wolfinger (1996) is a very good reference on mixed models in the context of using PROC MIXED, and Milliken and Johnson (1992, 1989, and in press) are good general references on experimental design, including mixed models. Mixed Models In this section, we define both the general linear model and the mixed general linear model (called hereafter the mixed model). We then give several examples, and demonstrate the use of both PROC GLM and PROC MIXED in the analysis of such data. The General Linear Model consists of Y=X + Where Y is the n -by- 1 matrix of response variables, X is the n -by- k design or model matrix, is the k -by- 1 matrix of parameters, and is the n -by- 1 error matrix. We assume, for consistency with the mixed model, that p , the number of columns in Y and equals 1; that is, this is a univariate general linear model. In this model, all effects, which are represented by columns of X , are assumed to be fixed effects .; that is, we assume that the levels of the factors represent either levels we manipulate, or are measured without error, and are the only levels in which we are interested. This is the model that PROC GLM fits. When we use PROC GLM, the CLASS and MODEL statements jointly specify t",25p020.pdf
"Using Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) to drive Microsoft Office applications such as Word and Excel has long been a technique utilized by SAS programmers. While alternatives exist (e.g., generating RTF code, OLE Automation), the use of DDE in conjunction with the native scripting languages of these applications has been appealing since implementation is simple and the macro recording capabilities of Office applications make script generation nearly automatic. Harris (SUGI 24 Proceedings, 1999) described a particularly elegant design for using the SAS System and DDE to populate Microsoft Word documents. Now that the more sophisticated Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) is the common development environment among all Office applications, however, DDE only works with Office application legacy macro languages. Employing Harris design, this paper describes a technique to simulate the ease of use of the DDE methodology while taking full advantage of VBA to automate Microsoft Word.",25p021.pdf
"s to gather user criteria for customized or ad hoc reports.    Some of the benefits are: only Base SAS is needed (no SAS/AF ), there is only one program to write and maintain, and the end-user, mainframe or PC, never has to edit any code. Several examples will demonstrate gathering single and multiple choices per parameter and conditionally gathering criteria. INTRODUCTION The SAS system provides a variety of information reporting capabilities which can be used for canned, hardcoded reports that are produced on a regular basis, and also reports with basic layouts whose specific contents change based on some criteria input by the user. Often, in the crunch of the request, a program is written with the specific criteria hard-coded. When the client wants the same report but for different criteria, someone must edit the code, find and modify the criteria, and maybe even test the changes. Sometimes programs are written with %LET statements and then given to users to edit with the criteria for that particular execution. Yikes! This paper examines several techniques to interactively gather the criteria for customized or ad hoc reports without anyone having to edit the code. If your site has licensed SAS/AF , a program entry could be created to gather user criteria. While this technique does provide a great deal of flexibility and macro programming options, it does add another layer of complexity to an application. What I proffer here is the use of Base SAS only, thus keeping things",25p022.pdf
"No, the user does NOT have to make up her/his mind. You can, indeed, build a WRITE-ONCE / USE-MANY / DO-ANY reporting application: build a tool, not a straightjacket. It is possible to provide users at any SAS site with reporting flexibility with minimum software investment. When a professional programmer designs and builds a reporting application, there is the understandable, but nevertheless unreasonable, expectation that intended users can foresee all needs. Deadly for deadlines, estimates, and budgets is expansion in project scope once work has begun, or is believed complete. A no-brainer, fixed-cost-certain way to provide user-definable ad hoc reporting is to buy more software, typically a fancy query or reporting tool. Well, it may come with its own limitations, and the inevitable tormenting temptation of future upgrades, to trade new limitations for old. This paper discusses at a high level, and the presentation will demonstrate in detail, how much flexibility and usability you can deliver in an ad hoc reporting application that was built with just Base SAS software and its no-addedcost macro facility.",25p023.pdf

"Implementing Public Sector Performance Management A Balanced Scorecard Approach Tim Calkins, SAS Institute Public Sector EXECUTIVE SUMMARY Paralysis by analysis is very common in executive management today. Many organizations are experiencing death by details. They are measuring and tracking the right information, but have no effective way to gather, organize and easily view data and report on information that would help the corner office thinkers make decisions. The balanced scorecard approach focuses on KPIs (key performance indicators).   KPIs are your organization's radar to the road ahead, acting as leading indicators to maneuver away from using last month's actuals as your forecast tool. Using past performance data (lagging indicators) to make decisions is like driving while looking in the rear view mirror. An effective balanced scorecard should have a mix of both outcome measures and performance drivers. Outcome measures without performance drivers do not communicate how the outcomes are to be achieved. Conversely, performance drivers without outcome measures may result in local improvements for the business unit, but are not likely to result in expanded or enhanced financial performance for the organization as a whole. This paper will examine a methodology to improve the process of linking performance measures and costs directly to programs through a balanced scorecard framework. It will also demonstrate how the combination of a data warehousing methodology can be coupled with the role of our SAS® System to build a clear integrated performance system. MANDATES ON PERFORMANCE Public sector managers have been flooded by a sea of mandates over the last ten years designed to monitor accountability for a department or agency to meet specific goals. This legislation was created to effect organizational towards greater efficiency. The most notable, is the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 (GPRA) which created a standard planning and performance report",25p026.pdf

"Pharmaceutical companies conduct many activities during the statistical analysis of their clinical data. This is one part in their larger process of collecting, managing, analyzing, and presenting all this clinical data (safety and efficacy). Many companies now provide considerable system support for the early part of this larger process, (i.e., the data collection and management), and for the later part when the New Drug Application (NDA) document is published and presented to a regulatory agency in electronic form. But much less has been done to support the work involved in the statistical analysis of the data using SAS Software, particularly Base SAS and the Macro Language. I discuss automated, integrated support for the statistical data analysis in this paper. I call this support a Submission Development Environment. An automated, integrated environment for this work is surely a challenge, but it offers much potential payoff if it can be achieved.",25p028.pdf
"Descriptive Epidemiology is concerned with the analysis of the incidence of diseases both geographically and over time. A characteristic of this field of study is the need for access to diverse types of data. These include data on disease incidence, population data from the region of study, data relating to diseases and map data sets at various geographical levels. The ability to manage such diverse data in a way which allows easy and efficient access to different subsets of data is an essential preliminary requirement to subsequent analysis. Preliminary investigations usually consist of the tabulation of age-specific incidence rates for each geographical region and the calculation of standardised rates, typically presented as standardised morbidity ratios (SMRs). Subsequent investigations include the analysis of variations in incidence rates with age, sex and geographical region, tests for spatial clustering and the use of maps to display SMRs. Thus, in addition to data management, an equally important requirement is access to a variety of analytical tools, ranging from simple tabulation facilities to sophisticated statistical and numerical techniques. This paper describes the development of a general application for use in Descriptive Epidemiology and illustrates its use by epidemiologists based at the University of Leeds.",25p029.pdf
"is paper, the authors define a CRT listing as a clinical report that interleaves a series of individual data listings (e.g., demographic characteristics, laboratory data, and vitals) by patient. The approach defined in this paper applies an efficient data integration process, and an important page consolidating post-processing algorithm. The SAS product used in this paper is SAS BASE on a UNIX platform. INTRODUCTION SAS programmers in the pharmaceutical industry support the clinical data analysis and reporting process. One of the more frequently requested reports is the Case Report Form Tabulation (CRT). It is a clinical report that interleaves individual data listings (e.g. demographic characteristics, laboratory data, and vitals) together for each patient. There are a number of methods to produce a CRT. A typical CRT listing program creates intermediate SAS data sets, and stores them in a temporary SAS Library. Then the reporting routine reads in the temporary data to interleave each patient's information in the listings. This paper presents an alternative approach that is simpler, more efficient, and produces a smaller number of pages of output. The approach skips the previously described first step of creating intermediate SAS data sets, and replaces it with an easier process for CRT reporting. The new approach consists of five steps, and it is discussed in the following sections using sample SAS code. DATA FILE For illustrative purposes, five data files from a hypothetic",25p030.pdf
"The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now strongly encourages all new drug applications (NDAs) be submitted electronically. Electronic submissions could help FDA application reviewers scan documents efficiently and check analyses by manipulating the very datasets and code used to generate them. The potential saving in reviewer time and cost is enormous while improving the quality of oversight. In January 1999, the FDA released the Guidance for Industry: Providing Regulatory Submissions in Electronic Format  NDAs .  As described, one important part of the application package is the case report tabulations (CRTs), now serving as the instrument for submitting datasets. CRTs are made up of two parts: first, datasets in SAS® transport file format and second, the accompanying documentation for the datasets. Herein, we briefly review the content and conversion of datasets to SAS transport file format, and then elaborate on the code that makes easy work of the accompanying dataset documentation (in the form of data definition tables) using the SAS Output Delivery System (ODS). The intended audience is SAS programmers with an intermediate knowledge of the BASE product used under any operating system and who are involved in the biotechnology industries.",25p031.pdf
"PROC REPORT is the most powerful and productive tool among all Base SAS® report generators. One of its most appreciated things is that there is no need to pre-figure the column position for each displayed variable and its header. However, some desired reporting-formats can not be accomplished by this procedure such as page break at a value of variable when its whole group cannot fit on a page, or wrapping up values of an ACROSS variable on the next page. And, it is inconvenient and timeconsuming for coders to use other SAS report generators for these desired formats. A macro to accomplish all of these with the full use of PROC REPORT has been developed at TAP Holdings Inc.. Additionally, it handles content-dependent footnotes, places page-numbering at a fixed position at the bottom of page and allows a combined use of aligning title and footnote texts on the left, on the right and in the center of page. This paper will describe the macros parameters, settings and functions, as well as demonstrate its use. It is targeted at those who are looking for an efficient way of generating reports or those who have experience with PROC REPORT. The macro is developed using SAS version 6.12 on the NT operating system. It can be used in other operating systems.",25p032.pdf
"An ideal SAS frequency table program would generate tables presenting counts (and percents based on those counts) derived from any sets of observations that a user specified, and would put them in the locations the user chose. It would also contain a WYSIWYG interface that made efficient use of code. This paper describes a new high-level frequency table generation language (FlexTab) designed to meet these special needs.   This language allows the user to control on a per-cell basis which observations to count to generate an N statistic (on the basis of specified variable values), and which two sets of observations to use to generate a fraction, converted to a percentage via PROC FORMAT.   It uses PROC MEANS with a CLASS statement to create a data set with all the necessary frequency counts and uses the RETAIN statement with newly created denominator variables to put numerator and denominator values for that fraction in the same observation.   The FlexTab compiler generates both this data manipulation code and its associated PROC TABULATE code.",25p033.pdf

"We all learned from data warehousing gurus and, sometimes from suffering the chaotic creations of our own, that we need to develop a metadata strategy and use it as we grow our data warehouse environments. The uses for metadata are growing and it is becoming an area of data warehousing that may be more dynamic than the data warehouse itself.   The industry is seeking to develop supporting standards. Vendors are continuously adjusting to the new demands created by their own development efforts, as well as those of others that create or use new metadata. SAS Institute is developing Metadata Architecture to support flexible storage and use of metadata by SAS applications, as well as other applications needing it.   These demands are increasingly diverse, requiring a robust architecture to ensure metadata integrity across this distributed environment. We also work to stay in step with industry-wide efforts toward consistent metadata standards.",25p036.pdf
"You should have a good understanding of your data before you begin writing a program. A PROC CONTENTS of the data provides information about the data, but no examples of the data. A PROC PRINT shows the data, but in the case of large datasets, is impractical. Using PROC UNIVARIATE you can get a lot of information about the data, but it is not always helpful for the naive user.

A program is a form of communication that occurs in two distinct and vastly different events: the first event is immediate: when the program is submitted to the language processor for execution; the second event takes place at a later time: when the writer or another programmer returns to read that program for maintenance. A good style sheet can facilitate program maintenance. This is especially important when simultaneously writing in two languages: SAS® and its macro language. This paper discusses elements of a style sheet for SAS® programmers. The intended audiences are intermediate SAS® programmers and beginning macro programmers.,25p038.pdf

"Some programs are created with hard-coded values that need to be changed on a regular basis. This amounts to rewriting the program every time a change is made to one of the parameters. For example, a report of hours worked by employees for certain days. If the person requesting the report is not versed in the ways of SAS System programming, then a programmer must go into the program, find the parameters to be changed, make the changes, and run the program. Instead, the program can be written with variables in place of the hard-coded values. Any user can change the variables at run-time by way of a graphical user interface (GUI) also known as a FRAME. This frees the programmer to create programs instead of running them for others. This procedure is sometimes known as wrapping. The base SAS program is wrapped in a SAS/AF program so that user interaction can be accomplished using visual objects (Text Entry boxes, Push Buttons, etc.) instead of re-writing the program each time a parameter needs to be changed.",25p041.pdf

Abolafia, UNC-CH, Department Of Biostatistics, Chapel Hill, NC Abstract The Output Delivery System (ODS) and PROC TEMPLATE introduced in Version 7 of the SAS® System has made procedure output more flexible. This paper demonstrates how the International Studies Project has used these tools to easily produce both tabular and graphical HTML formatted output. The paper also discusses how ODS can be used to create a navigation system to organize large volumes of output and how ODS can be used to customize procedure output. Introduction The International Studies Project necessitates continuous collaboration between investigators from the United States, China, Pakistan, Russia, and Poland. In the past, email, FAX, and mail were the primary methods of communication and the sharing of data among investigators. These methods were slow and unreliable and often delayed the preparation of manuscripts. This paper demonstrates how the International Studies Project has been able to use the world wide web combined with new SAS tools introduced in Version 7 to facilitate and speed up the manuscript preparation process. Through a series of examples, we will show how the International Studies Project: 1) used ODS to easily create HTML formatted output; 2) used ODS to create a navigation system to organize large volumes of output; 3) used output objects to change the default output and more concisely present data; 4) used ODS and newly available SAS/GRAPH® drivers to output graph",25p043.pdf
"In an effort to improve semiconductor product yields, an engineering data analysis application was developed in 1989 for engineers at Motorolas Advanced Products Research and Development Laboratory (APRDL).

"Paper 46-25 From the Analysts to the Executive -- Business Visualization and Enterprise Reporting with the SAS ® System Joe Costanzo, SAS Institute Inc.    Ben Zenick, SAS Institute Inc . Over the past decade, many large organizations have deployed data warehousing technology to furnish their end user community, customers, and partners with the data necessary to improve the way they make business decisions. A key component of a successful enterprise data warehouse strategy is the Enterprise Reporting System (ERS). Most organizations are seeing enterprise level reporting systems as not only necessary but strategically imperative to bring these dysfunctional, department level data stores and reporting applications under control. This paper will explore options for expounding upon existing deployments as well as coordinating new technologies with existing infrastructure. Enterprise reporting systems (ERS) are systematically designed to meet the data access and information discovery needs of the majority of end users within an organization. These systems should combine the ease of use and simplicity that users have come to demand, while maintaining the ability to create complex multivariable reports from any data source available to the system. In short, enterprise reporting should connect users to the business by allowing for fast and easy access to daily corporate knowledge. Several factors have contributed to limiting the design and deployment of reporting systems off of the typical data stores. During the early 1990's, the need to do enhanced reporting increased substantially, creating a massive overload and backlog of reports that most IT shops were not staffed to handle. As a result, many business units adopted new GUI reporting tools and began to implement reporting systems on an application by application basis. Although this approach proved successful in reducing the information access time and report generation time, many business units inadvertently created i",25p046.pdf
"Frequently, there are customers, internal or external to a business, that require timely email notification regarding the successful completion of certain important MVS jobs. Or, perhaps they wish to receive via email the various reports generated by these jobs. In any case, MVS is not inherently email-friendly, and, more often than not, programmers must download reports to a PC, set up a list of email recipients, scribble a quick explanatory note in the body of the email, attach the saved reports documents, and finally, press SEND. This works fine for one-off, ad hoc jobs. But, what if this level of notification is required for repetitive jobs? For example, what if a dataset is updated monthly, and certain interested parties would prefer email notification, rather than awaiting a telephone call or scrounging around the mainframe to verify the datasets update status? How about a job that creates both statistical reports and a dataset for an external customer on a daily basis? In such cases, it would be both convenient and expedient to have the MVS job automatically set up and send the email (with or without reports) to the appropriate parties. What follows is one possible way to resolve this issue, using Base SAS in a Batch MVS environment to set up and drive the movement of email text, reports, and recipient lists from MVS to an UNIX email server, which in turn sends the email to the desired parties. Set this up as a JCL PROC, and it makes a functional and fairly simple semi-automated email process.",25p048.pdf

"en suggested over the years to solve the problem of debugging Data step logic. Until now SAS programmers have never been able to interactively watch the Data step execute and debug their logic as it executes. Introduced in Release 6.11 of SAS, the Data Step Debugger is part of Base SAS software. It is an interactive tool that allows the SAS user the ability to watch and control DATA step execution. The Data Step Debugger can be used to: * watch program logic execute * examine variable values as they change * repeat program statements * jump to other sections of the DATA step * modify DO loops interactively * test for ""dead"" code * give commands * observe the results interactively The Data Step Debugger is a very useful tool, whether you are a Beginning SAS Programmer or a SAS veteran. This Tutorial will demonstrate how to use the Debugger. It will review the Debugger commands, and demonstrate how they can be used to improve the debugging process. While this is a Beginning Tutorial, the subject matter is appropriate for all levels of SAS expertise if you have not previously been introduced to the Data Step Debugger.

"The Input Statement: Where It's @ Ronald Cody, Ed.D., Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, Piscataway, NJ Introduction One of the most powerful features of SAS software is the ability to read data in almost any form. For example, you can have data values separated by blanks or other delimiters or you can arrange your data in columns, using one or more lines of data for each subject. You can also read selected data fields and then decide how to read the remaining data values. This tutorial will give you an overview of the immense power and flexibility of the SAS INPUT statement. Reading Space Delimited Data A common form of data entry is to separate each data value by one or more spaces. This is handy for small data sets that are entered by hand, especially for test purposes. This arrangement of data is often called ""list directed"" data. The rule here is that you must specify all the variables in the data lines and all the data values must be separated by one or more spaces. You must also indicate which variables are to be read as character data. Look at the following example: ***LIST DIRECTED INPUT; DATA LIST;    INPUT X Y A $ Z; DATALINES; 1 2 HELLO 3 4     5     GOODBYE   6 ; PROC PRINT DATA=LIST;    TITLE 'LIST DIRECTED INPUT'; RUN; Notice that you need to list the variable names on the INPUT statement and to place a dollar sign ($) after any variable that is to hold character values. Also notice that the second line of data which has multiple spaces between each data value causes no problems at all. Delimiters Other Than Spaces With just a small change to the program, you can indicate any delimiter you like, in place of the default blank. To understand how this works, we need to jump ahead a bit to see how a SAS program reads data from an external data file (as opposed to data following a DATALINES statement). You do this by including an INFILE statement which tells the program where to find the data. The INFILE statement has several options that provide addition",25p053.pdf
"Introduction S-M-U. Some people will see these three letters and immediately think of the abbreviation for a private university and associated football team in Texas. Others might treat them as a three-letter word, and recall a whimsical cartoon character created by Al Capp many years ago. However, in the world of the SAS ® user, these three letters represent the building blocks for processing SAS datasets through the SAS DATA step. S, M, and U are first letters in the words SET, MERGE, and UPDATE  the 3 commands used to introduce SAS data into a DATA step. This presentation will discuss the syntax for the SET, MERGE, and UPDATE commands. It will compare and contrast these 3 commands. Finally, it will provide appropriate uses for each command, along with basic examples that will illustrate the main points of the presentation. SET Statement According to the Version 6 SAS Language Reference , the SET statement  reads observations from one or more existing SAS datasets.   Under ordinary circumstances, each variable, on each observation, on each SAS dataset specified by the SET statement, is read into the SAS Program Data Vector, and each is subsequently written out to the new output SAS dataset - although this can be overridden with other logic in the DATA step. The basic SET statement is very simple: DATA newdata; SET olddata; /* additional statements */ RUN; In this simple example, the SET statement introduces each record in SAS dataset olddata into the current DATA step.",25p054.pdf

"Anyone who has ever worked with data is familiar with the adage data are messy. And whether you have collected the data yourself, or inherit a dataset, there is usually missing data. This paper will discuss the issue of missing data and the techniques for identifying, processing, and manipulating missing data. Topics to be discussed will include how SAS * processes data in the program data vector, the best methods to input data that may contain blank or missing values, and what to do when an invalid or missing data error message is encountered in the log. How missing variables are coded and how to differentiate missing numeric data with the MISSING statement in the data step will be explored. How SAS *   sorts missing values will be examined. Techniques such as the difference between the MISSOVER option in the input statement and the MISSING= SAS * system option, the efficiency of the RETAIN statement and the use of the SUM function vs. mathematic calculations will be explored. Considerations when doing IF THEN/ELSE statements with missing data will also be discussed. Ways to identify missing data using PROC FREQ, PROC UNIVARIATE and PROC MEANS with the NMISS option will be compared. And lastly, avoiding propagation of missing values in calculations will be explained.",25p056.pdf

However since there are so many functions, some programmers are unaware of potentially valuable tools. To make matters    worse many functions have been added to the SAS System since the Version 6 manuals were first published, and consequently many of these functions are under utilized. Additionally most of the functions that were originally only available in Screen Control Language are now, starting with the latest releases of Version 6, available in the DATA step. Selected functions from the categories of new, under utilized, neglected, and formerly SCL are discussed through the use of examples.

"PAPER 61-25 INTRODUCTION TO PROC SQL ® Rosalind Gusinow, Systems Seminar Consultants, Inc., Madison, WI ABASTRACT PROC SQL is a powerful Base SAS PROC which combines the functionality of the DATA and PROC Steps into a single procedure. PROC SQL in many cases can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. PROC SQL can be used to retrieve, update, and report on information from SAS data sets or other database products. This paper will concentrate on SQL's syntax and how to access information from existing SAS data sets. Some of the topics covered include: Write SQL code using various styles of the SELECT statement. Dynamically create new variables on the SELECT statement. Use SQL options to control the appearance of reports. Create multiple reports with a single PROC SQL step. Create reports containing percentages using PROC SQL. Use CASE/WHEN clauses for conditionally processing the data. Joining data from two or more data sets (like a MERGE!). WHY LEARN PROC SQL? PROC SQL can not only retrieve information without having to learn SAS syntax, but it can often do this with fewer and shorter statements than traditional SAS code. Additionally, on average it uses fewer resources than conventional DATA and PROC steps. This means PROC SQL can be a more efficient alternative to traditional SAS code. Further, the knowledge learned is transferrable to other SQL packages. AN EXAMPLE OF PROC SQL'S SYNTAX Every PROC SQL must have at least one SELECT statement. The purpose of the SELECT statement is to name the columns that will appear on the report and the order in which they will appear (similar to a VAR statement on PROC PRINT). The FROM clause names the data set from which the information will be extracted from (similar to the SET statement). One advantages of SQL is that new variables can be dynamically created on the SELECT statement, which is a feature we do not normally associate with a SAS Procedure: PROC SQL;   SELECT STATE, SALES,     (SALES * .05) AS TAX",25p061.pdf

"ides hundreds of ways you can analyze your data. You can use the DATA step to slice and dice your data, and there are dozens of procedures that will process your data and produce all kinds of statistics. But odds are that no matter how you organize and analyze your data, youll end up producing a report in the form of a table. This is why every SAS user needs to know how to use PROC TABULATE. While TABULATE doesnt do anything that you cant do with other PROCs, the payoff is in the output. TABULATE computes a variety of statistics, and it neatly packages the results in a single table. Unfortunately, TABULATE has gotten a bad rap as being a difficult procedure to learn. This paper will prove that if you take things step by step, anyone can learn PROC TABULATE. * I NTRODUCTION This paper will start out with the most basic onedimensional table. We will then go on to two-dimensional tables, tables with totals, and finally, three-dimensional tables. By the end of this paper, you will be ready to build most basic TABULATE tables. * O NE -D IMENSIONAL T ABLES To really understand TABULATE, you have to start very simply. The simplest possible table in TABULATE has to have three things: a PROC TABULATE statement, a TABLE statement, and a CLASS or VAR statement. In this example, we will use a VAR statement.

"lting, Chapel Hill, North Carolina ABSTRACT What tools do you use to generate reports or listings? PROC PRINT, PROC TABULATE, or DATA _NULL_? Perhaps it is time to check out the flexibility and features of PROC REPORT. An easy way to begin is to follow the 80/20 rule by using the interactive REPORT windows to get a head start on the syntax and options. After quickly creating a program for the essential parts of a report, you will have time left over to consider enhancements that may require more complex features. This beginning tutorial provides examples that you can follow to learn the steps involved in building reports interactively. The intent is to provide a starting point for making better use of PROC REPORT, not to present an overview of available features. Most methods apply to Release 6.11/6.12 and Version 7/8. Although ODS and the new STYLE options are mentioned, the focus is on basic features of REPORT that exist in Release 6.11 or later. REPORT PROCEDURE BASICS The REPORT procedure was designed as a flexible report writing tool that combines features of the PRINT, MEANS, and TABULATE procedures along with PUT capabilities commonly used in the DATA step. The features have remained stable since Release 6.11. You can use PROC REPORT in three ways: 1) windowing environment with prompting 2) windowing environment without prompts 3) batch program code Using the windowing environment still creates program code, you just do not have to remember the syntax.

"PROC MEANS and its close relative PROC SUMMARY have been two of the work horse procedures that all users of SAS software learn to know intimately. Version 7 and 8 of the SAS System brought many changes to these procedures that give both the programmer and analyst new opportunities to efficiently summarize their data.

The FREQ procedure can be used for more than just obtaining a simple frequency distribution or a 2-way cross-tabulation.  Multidimension tables can be analyzed using proc FREQ. There are many options which control what statistical test is performed as well as what output is produced. Some of the tests require that the data satisfy certain conditions. Some options produce a set of results from which one must select appropriately for the situation at hand. Which of the results produced by using the CHISQ option should one use? What is the WEIGHT statement for? Why would one create an output data set with the OUT= option? This paper (beginning tutorial) will answer these questions as many of the options available in Proc FREQ are reviewed.,25p069.pdf

"Since the inception of the INTERNET and Web Browsers, the need for speedy information to make split second business decisions has become part of our daily lives. However, information retrieved from the Web can be overwhelming at times due to the immense size of the data, which is only the beginning of the problem. Web Browsers allow users to access information with ease; however, the number of records a user is able to browse at one time is limited to the amount of memory and processor on their computer. One of the many ways to circumvent the problem is to upgrade their computer with a faster processor and more memory, which is expensive. Therefore, it would be easier to control the number of records the user can view at any one time, and provide an option to allow them to download all of the data if required. This will eliminate the possibility of a frozen keyboard and the need to reboot the computer and would also eliminate any frustrations.",25p071.pdf
"Portable Document Format (PDF) specification allows complex documents to be shared across platforms and operating systems, independent of the software used to develop them. For SAS output, PDF can be used to conveniently distribute reports to a variety of clients, store the SAS component of a much larger document, such as a pharmaceutical new drug application, or archive historical results. Although tools such as the PDF virtual printer driver, and the Adobe Distiller allow anyone to create PDF files, it does require additional software, and a separate, manual step. The SAS2PDF macro was developed to provide the ability to convert standard SAS output to the PDF specification within the SAS job, and without the need for any additional software. ABOUT PDF While PDF has been overshadowed somewhat by HTML as an information exchange format, PDF has some notable advantages over HTML. PDF provides much greater flexibility in creating complex documents, containing diagrams and images. PDF is also better suited to managing large documents (100-100,000 pages) because of its indexed object format. Any single page in a document can be viewed almost as fast as the host system can render it. In addition to these advantages, PDF also shares most of the same platformindependence and hypertext features that HTML provides. Why Use PDF for SAS output? While SAS does provide some functionality for printing text on a page, it is either not specific enough to fully instruct an arbitrary printer (",25p072.pdf

As referred to in this paper, a descriptive index is simply a listing of the name of each SAS program in a directory and its corresponding description. Using a pipe to communicate between the SAS System and Windows NT, base SAS code can be used to create a list of all SAS programs in a directory, get each programs description as written in the programs standard header, and output an index that lists each programs name and its accompanying description. This paper describes a SAS macro that uses the methods above to automate the creation of this index.

"ices, Sandy, UT ABSTRACT The autocall macro facility allows users to access the same macro code from multiple SAS ® programs. Rather than have the same macro code in each program where the code is required, with an autocall macro, the code is in one location. This permits faster updates and better consistency across all programs. This paper will briefly discuss using the SAS autocall macro facility in the Microsoft Windows environment. HOW AUTOCALL MACRO FACILITY WORKS Macro Set-up The first step is to set up a SAS program that contains the macro desired to be used in multiple programs. Although the program may contain other macros and/or open code, it is advised to include only one macro. The macro must be named the same as the name of the file (e.g., %HMOMAP1 and HMOMAP1.SAS). For example, the file named HMOMAP1.SAS may contain the following code: %Macro Hmomap1; Data Hmomap; Set IPCare; If Hmo = 1 then Name = Utah; Else if Hmo = 2 then Name = California; Else if Hmo = 3 then Name = Nevada; Else if Hmo = 4 then Name = Arizona; %Mend Hmomap1; This macro would create a new dataset called HMOMAP containing everything in the old dataset (IPCare) with the addition of a new variable, NAME. Be sure that the dataset being modified does not contain a variable called NAME or it will be re-assigned a new value and/or may result in variable type errors. Since each user may define the variables differently, parameters can be passed to the autocall macro in the same manner as a s",25p075.pdf
"a quick solution for developing applications on the run. Time constraints or lack of SAS AF® expertise on-site may necessitate the use of Macro Windows. INTRODUCTION Macro Windows are easy to construct and have various options to allow the developer to control the size, content and even color of the window. Macro programs are used to drive the application. A thorough working knowledge of SAS Macro language is helpful. Application The application presented here allows the user to perform statistical analysis without the intervention of a programmer and/or statistician. The project design was coordinated with the project statistician and the user. A series of macro programs define the windows, allow access to project data files, perform edit checks and run the requested statistical analysis. The controlling program is the macro guide. It contains all of the window definitions and invokes a macro program (demog) which displays the first window. This program checks for a valid filename and performs edit checks. Other windows are displayed and macros invoked depending on user input and/or the successful completion of edit checks. If a filename is entered incorrectly, a window opens telling the user that it is an invalid filename and to try again. Most of the macro code used in this application checks values of macro variables, assigns values to macro variables and opens new windows.

Piet                                IBM Storage Subsystems Division, Tucson Arizona It is often necessary to search a large data set or file for information on a list of items, or to update a large data set with data accompanying the items in the list. The method most commonly suggested for doing this is to sort both data sets by the item and merge them. The sort/merge method is efficient when the large data set is already sorted by the search item, but more often than not, the search item is located in a non-indexed field in one or more files or data sets not under your control. Not only are the manipulations involving the large data set time consuming, but it is also very easy to mis-code the merge data step introducing insidious errors into your data. Other suggested methods involve setting up SAS formats for the search items. This is much more efficient, but again, setting up the code can be tricky. I called this paper ""table lookup on the fly"", because there are many situations in which the search table can be set up using only one line of code by using a call to SYMPUT, and the data extracted by using only one line of code using a call to SYMGET.   This is possible when the search item meets the requirements of a SAS macro variable. It must begin with an alphabetic character, contain only alphanumeric characters, and be the proper length. I run my SAS applications on an MVS system on an IBM mainframe, and the variable length is limited to only eight characters, however I understand the length may be 2**36 on some systems. To insure that the macro variable starts with a valid character and to avoid conflict with other macro variables, I usually concatenate an alphabetic character to the search key. This is best seen with some examples: EXAMPLE 1: EXTRACTING RECORDS FROM A LARGE FILE You design various circuit cards which are",25p078.pdf
"In data entry, text fields are usually entered in uppercases. When printing out these text fields, one would prefer having them in the form of normal writing, combining upper and lowercases. One example is comments fields. Having words in upper and lower cases will enhance readability, conformity, and consistency with the rest of the report. This paper introduces a macro that would transform text fields from uppercases to a format of upper and lower cases. The macro is written in such a way that the first letter of each sentence is preserved as uppercase. Exceptions are taken into consideration when acronyms and abbreviations in uppercases are intentional. Users can provide their own list of acronyms and abbreviations to customize usage.",25p079.pdf
"%included code or used macros with embedded SAS code, it is often frustrating to miss inline comments in the log or be unable to clearly track what the program has done. You can always turn on the SOURCE2 or MPRINT/MLOGIC options, but that sometimes gets to be too much. Likewise, you can add your own comments with %PUT, but you have to go to a lot of work to make them look nice. This paper discusses a macro which formats comments which are written to the SAS log. The comment is bordered with asterisks and the user can control indentation, justification and line breaks. Macro references in the comment are resolved so comments can be made dynamic. The border automatically adjusts to the size of the longest line and there is no limit to the length or number of lines in the comment. You get consistent, formatted comments with fewer keystrokes than keying all those %PUT statements yourself. The Call To create your comment, simply pass it as the parameter of the %COMMENT macro. By default, separate comment lines are delimited by commas. When processed, the comment will be displayed in the log, bounded by asterisks, with each line left justified. For example, the following invocation: %COMMENT(This is a test,of the comment macro); would produce the following in the log: ************************ * This is a test       * * of the comment macro * ************************ There is no limit to the number of lines or the length of each line, though lines will wrap at the LINESIZE limit.

"is antennae and wiggle his finger to get a job done, sometimes it is helpful to enhance your SAS toolkit with functions and utilities youve written yourself. This paper briefly discusses a number of functions Ive written that have become invaluable tools. SAS is a powerful, robust language. There are functions and formats that allow you to read, write and manipulate data almost anyway you need to. However, every once in a while you come up with a situation that you need a few lines of code or a few embedded functions to handle. This is where the SAS macro facility can come to the rescue. DATE FUNCTIONS SAS has numerous date functions, formats, and informats. There are times, however, when you cant quite get what you want. For example, the INTNX function will increment a SAS date value by a specified number of intervals. However, the result is always the first (or last or middle) day of the interval. For example, if x=4/1/1999, the following   Y = intnx(year,x,3) will result in 1/1/2002  the first day of the year that 3 years from the base date. What if we need a function which will return the same date, x number of years into the future. Heres a little macro function to do just that. %macro AddYears(base,add);   intnx('month',&base,&add*12) + (day(&base)-1) %mend; The %AddYears macro increments the date to the right month by incrementing by months (years * 12) instead of years.

Frequently, the data summarized in these reports arise from multiple sources and come at varying schedules. Managing the receipt of data for complex trials can require a large organizational effort on the part of the coordinating center to ensure that each report uses the most current data. In this paper we present a system of dynamic data set selection and project management that uses SAS 6.12 and Windows NT 4.0 file system. In this system, programs used in the production of DSMB reports include at their beginnings a central utility program. This program automatically assigns LIBNAMEs to the most recent source data and provides a macro that checks whether we have updated analysis files with the most recent source data, thereby alleviating us of the tedious task of manually updating every analysis program. Although the code is somewhat complicated, SAS users at any level can use this program. THE PROBLEM During the course of many randomized clinical trials, the independent statistical coordinating center frequently is called upon to review data quality and provide unblinded analyses of study data to a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) chartered to review the safety and efficacy of the study agent. Often, the DSMB reviews fre",25p082.pdf
"Paper 83-25 What We Really Need is a %BY Statement  V2 Ray Pass Ray Pass Consulting Heres the scenario. You have to produce a series of different reports from the same overall population, and each report has to be run separately for each level of a specified bygroup (or combination of bygroups) in the population. The catch is that the client (boss, whatever) wants the report output to appear in bygroup order; i.e. all reports for bygroup-1, then all reports for bygroup-2, etc. Another catch is that you dont necessarily know a priori what the different levels of the bygroup are, or even how many there are; in fact, this is to be part of a routine production system where these bygroup levels will most assuredly be changing from run to run. There are undoubtedly many ways to handle a situation like this. The first version of this little paper showed one method. Since writing that paper, and using that method many times, I have found a better way to do it. This method was demonstrated on SAS-L a while back. Assume the data exist in a SAS data set called alldata with a classifying variable called byvar . For this example, there happen to be three levels of byvar (by1, by2, by3), although the method works with any number of levels and you dont have to specify them beforehand. Actually, the method will only work with as many instances of byvar values as can be contained in a macro variable (plus one extra separator character per value), so it is SAS version dependent. This limitation should not really be a problem and can be dealt with by some other clever SAS programmer. Youve got three reports to run and you need them to be produced in the following order: Rep-1 for Bygroup-1 Rep-2 for Bygroup-1 Rep-3 for Bygroup-1 Rep-1 for Bygroup-2 Rep-2 for Bygroup-2 Rep-3 for Bygroup-2 Rep-1 for Bygroup-3 Rep-2 for Bygroup-3 Rep-3 for Bygroup-3 First you use PROC SQL to create two counter macro variables, &mcount and &mbyvals , which respectively contain the number of",25p083.pdf

"we can use the date functions, particularly INTNX, and the CALL SYMPUT routine to automatically produce date values. Applications include calling data sets stamped with dates, updating dates in a data step expression, and putting dates into reports.

In this paper, we will examine some applications that use dates, propose an automated solution to refresh the dates, and then revisit the applications to make the required automation.

"One of the new functions in Base SAS ® released in Version 6.12 is SPEDIS, which returns a measure of how a word is close to another word in spelling - an asymmetric spelling distance between the two words. The function can be efficiently used for such tasks as finding specific values of character variables in a data set, merging data sets, or subsetting data using a character variable when there is a possibility of different spellings or misspellings of its value. In many cases, the SPEDIS function works better for these tasks than other SAS functions  INDEX, SCAN. It is especially useful as an addition to other functions to refine the search for specific values. The challenge is to set up a certain spelling distance, which allows the user to select the relevant values of the character variable. One of the approaches to that is to start with a deliberately large value of the spelling distance and then reduce the distance after studying the output until arriving at the value of the SPEDIS function which selects only or mostly the desirable values of the character variable.

"IL ABSTRACT A custom query tool written for a broad audience presents certain problems for the programmer. Some users are content with the point and click interface while power users want to type in code. In variable transformations such as logs and ratios, both approaches can result in errors if the data is at all dirty. We wanted to protect our system against mistakes in user-entered code as well as data problems, while still providing the flexibility of user defined variables. The new string functions rxparse and rxsubstr provide a clean approach to the problem that is easy to implement. This paper presents two SCL methods that utilize these functions to generate code-saving code: checks that prevent defined run-time errors. THE PROBLEM With a user base that stretches from analysts to marketers, our query tool has to meet a broad range of needs. One of the requirements for this system is the ability for users to define a variable on an ad-hoc basis. For a marketer this might be something as simple as % Paid Life to Date, or for a statistical modeler it could be an equation as long as this paper. Both of these situations present the same problem on a different scale. If % Paid is calculated as Total Ordered / Total Paid, then we get divide by zero errors when the customer is a freeloader who hasnt paid at all. Likewise, our statistician could be trying to take the square root of a negative number. Either way, our code would crash at run time, when all we needed to protect",25p087.pdf
"Users and SAS Programmers of any experience level. It reviews the syntax, basic applications, and troubleshooting of the SUBSTR Data Step Function. INTRODUCTION The SAS data step function SUBSTR (commonly pronounced substring) function is used to work with a specific position or positions of characters within a defined character variable. The function focuses on a portion of a string and can go on either side of the = sign in a data step statement. SYNTAX The SUBSTR function has three arguments: SUBSTR(SOURCE, POSITION, N) The function returns N characters, beginning at character number POSITION from the string SOURCE. SOURCE This is the larger or reference string. It can be a variable or a string of characters. POSITION This value is a positive integer and references the starting point to begin reading the internal group of characters. N This value is a positive integer and references the number of characters to read from the starting point POSITION in the field SOURCE. APPLICATIONS There are two basic applications of the SUBSTR function: on the right side of an assignment statement or on the left side of an assignment statement.

"8 of the SAS® system has been in major new features such as the Output Delivery System and long variable and table names. Hidden within the ""Changes and Enhancements"" documentation, however, are many other useful new items. This paper summarizes several enhancements to SAS informats, formats, and functions, and describes how they can make life easier for programmers who know about them. INTRODUCTION Informats, formats, and functions -- often referred to affectionately by true SAS aficionados as ""IFFs"" -- are among the most valuable tools in the SAS system. They enable a skilled SAS programmer to read data in an almost unbelievable variety of representations, and to write data back out in just as many ways, if not a few more. What other piece of software can read in RMF timestamps, octal and hex values, and column-binary files, and write values out as fractions, Julian dates, and Roman numerals? In between using informats to get data into SAS and formats to get data out, you can use over 150 SAS functions to compute accumulated depreciation, convert FIPS codes to state names, generate random variates from a Cauchy distribution, or translate all occurrences of one character to another. When experienced SAS programmers review programs written by SAS novices, one common theme is the amount of code written to accomplish some task that could be done with a single call to an appropriate function. Such code can take hours to write, and even longer to debug. The solution to this prob",25p089.pdf

SAS/SCONNECT provides three ways to accomplish this, data transfer services, remote library services and compute services. This paper illustrates how compute services can be used to efficiently process data in a global client/server environment. This paper is intended for users with a basic knowledge of SAS. INTRODUCTION The PRA global network consists of similar SAS installations at each Trial Management Center (TMC) which are interconnected via a wide area network (WAN) as illustrated in Figure 1. Figure 1: PRA Computing Infrastructure Each TMC has a Windows NT server setup as a dedicated SAS server. The SAS server is connected to a Windows NT file server and an Oracle database server. This configuration allows SAS jobs to be submitted from any SAS workstation to the SAS server at any TMC. Once a job has been submitted, a new SAS session is initiated on the server for that job. When the job is complete, the output and log are sent back to the workstation or to a file. SAS jobs may also be run on the workstation, but there are several advantages to running them on the server.

As an added bonus, it crunches that old mainframe mystery, JCL (Job Control Language), into a denormalized SAS file (table) / report which almost anyone in your IBM mainframe shop can understand. INTRODUCTION The job you see here I wrote to fill a need for my Y2K system testing team at a Fortune 500 company. We needed to rapidly analyze a great number of production batch jobstreams. In particular, we had to find out what a jobstreams input files were as well as its output files, and trace the history of those files dispositions. If you have ever tried to comprehend lots of JCL by looking at it, you know the tedium involved. We simplified our work by running this code and downloading its output to a MS/Access database for the whole team.

", Inc., Cary, NC. USA Abstract The SAS Companion for the Microsoft Windows Environment illustrates one technique for opening Microsoft Excel from within SAS using DDE.   This technique has several disadvantages. First, it does not check whether Excel is already open, it can unintentionally open multiple Excel sessions and this can be problematic. Second, it does not know with certainty when it has opened Excel, it relies on the SLEEP function to pause processing until a set amount of time has passed. Hopefully, the amount of time is sufficient for Excel to open successfully, but there is no guarantee. Finally, this set amount of time must be predetermined and sufficient for the worst case scenario (i.e. the slowest machine on which the code might possibly be run). This means the pause is always set higher than the minimum amount of time required for Excel to open, does not take advantage of the best resources available, and causes the end user to wait unnecessarily. While this technique was the best available when the SAS Companion for the Microsoft Windows Environment was published, the porting of some of the SCL functions to Base SAS has enabled another solution to this problem, one that is much more intelligent. With these functions it is possible to have SAS check if Excel is open. If Excel is not open, then open Excel, and continually check if Excel has finished opening successfully. As soon as Excel has finished opening, then proceed with the SAS processing. This techni",25p097.pdf

Because of the popularity of Excel as an end-user tool and the power and flexibility of the SAS System to deliver information, integration of these two resources is inevitable. One of the most popular and powerful protocols for integrating SAS and Excel is Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE). However, SAS can not send VBA commands to Excel using DDE.

"Paper 105-25 PROC REPORT  Land of the Missing OBS Column Ray Pass Ray Pass Consulting As full-featured as PROC REPORT is with all of its bells, whistles, bangles and bows, its missing a few plain old-fashioned features that we are all accustomed to from our day-to-day mundane workings with PROC PRINT. One of these is the automatic printing of observation numbers in the standard output. They can be turned off in PROC PRINT with the noobs option, but there is no option to turn them on in PROC REPORT. That is not to say that it cant be done in REPORT; its just not there as an option toggle switch. Consider the following standard PROC PRINT code and its resulting output: *-------------------; proc print data=test; run; *-------------------;    OBS    REPVAR1    REPVAR2    REPVAR3     1       aaa        726        736     2       bbb        187        675     3       ccc        365        746 Now here is the same dataset as displayed by the following vanilla PROC REPORT code: *-------------------------; Proc report data=test nowd; Run; *-------------------------;       REPVAR1     REPVAR2    REPVAR3       aaa             726        736       bbb             187        675       ccc             365        746 Its easy to see whats missing.

If youve been using the full power of PROC REPORT, youre aware that there are six types of variables in the procedure: DISPLAY, ANALYSIS, ORDER, GROUP, COMPUTED and ACROSS. There is however another dimension of variable types used in REPORT, but not one that is immediately obvious however because you dont actually use it to label variables.

"The different methods and the reasons for choosing a particular method of joining are contrasted and compared. Potential problems and limitations when joining data sets are also discussed. The need to combine data sets constantly arises during software development, as does the need to validate and test new code. There are two basic types of join, vertical , and horizontal. Vertical joining is appending one data set to another, whereas horizontal joining is using one or more key variables to combine different observations. Vertical Joining A good example of vertical joining is adding to a data set in time sequence, for example, adding Februarys sales data to Januarys sales data to give a year-todate data set. Providing both data sets have the same variables and all the variables have the same attributes such as data type, length, and label, there is no problem. However, once the data sets are combined at least one of the variables should, in practice, be able to identify which of the source data sets any given observation originated from. In this sales data example a date or month name should be present to indicate whether a given observation came from Januarys data or Februarys data. Another issue may be the sort order. In this example there is no need to sort the resulting data set if the source data sets are in date order, but if, say, the data sets were sorted by product code, or sales representative the resulting data set would need to be resorted by date.

"diate experience using SAS/GRAPH . It presents some simple applications of SAS ANNOTATE facility to achieve customtailoring of the axes for the plot produced via PROC GPLOT. While PROC GPLOT does a pretty good job with auto-selection of tick marks on the axes, sometimes the built-in functionality fails. This happens when the plotted data points are irregularly spaced and you want your tick marks to correspond to data points in the graph. Another example is when PROC GPLOT is used with the ANNO option and the annotate data set has data points outside the natural data range used in PROC GPLOT. In such cases, the common solution is to determine the new range of axes and to specify the ORDER option in the AXIS statement. Sometimes, however, it is not easy to determine the optimal value of the BY step in the ORDER option. Left to SAS, the selection of the BY step can be less then ideal. The notes below suggest an alternative way to label the tick marks when other solutions fail. We present two examples and suggest a method to format the axis in a desired manner.

"Production-Strength Data Mining Solution for Terabyte-Class Relational Data Warehouses Michael Nichols, John Zhao, John David Campbell IXL, Inc. RME Purpose and Processes Profitability for leading corporations depends on increasing revenue while containing advertising and marketing costs. In an effort to acquire a complete customer profile, many organizations have created large, customer-centric relational databases. After compiling and centralizing customer data, companies are faced with the challenge of translating volumes of customer data into knowledge that can be acted upon. To maintain a competitive edge, marketing analysts need to be able to access and interpret customer information accurately and efficiently. With Tessera's Rapid Modeling Environment (RME), companies can develop applications quickly so that marketing analysts can access and interpret customer information on an ad-hoc basis. Tessera's RME improves an organizations overall analytic capabilities such as segmentation, profiling, and scoring. Unlike data mining tools on the market today, Tessera's RME lets analysts perform scheduled production scoring against the full customer base. In addition, analysts can capture generated scores and write them back to the marketing database. Knowledge-Based Marketing Increased competition is driving organizations to leverage information gained about their current and prospective customer base so that they can market to them more effectively. Companies perform a complex multi-step process to mine customer information from data warehouses. Marketers use the results from these tools to develop and deploy marketing campaigns. The company tracks the response rates from these campaigns and feeds back this information into the customer database. The company then uses the enhanced customer data to refine its models and develop new marketing campaigns.

"te, Inc. ABSTRACT The construction of a warehouse using data from DuPont Pharmaceuticals Clinical Pharmacokinetics Group with the SAS/Warehouse Administrator product is described herein. Data sources incorporated into the pharmacokinetic warehouse existed in multiple formats (Oracle, Excel, SAS data sets, etc) and were represented by numerous individual files, rather then few large files. In most cases, the data density enjoys low granularity. The pharmacokinetic data warehouse draws data from many sources represented by multiple departments and spans long drug development cycles with varying degrees of detail. Additionally, data originated from both internal legacy systems or was obtained from an external contract research organization (CRO). Remote systems have been easily identified within the warehouse and views rather than distinct copies have been incorporated as data sources. The SAS/Warehouse Administrator product was essential to this effort as it organized the metadata from the various operational data definitions (ODD), assisted in the cleaning / scrubbing of the data via user-written code, and facilitated the creation of multi-dimensional databases (MDDB), datamarts and infomarts which were front-ended by exploitation tools including SAS/IntrNet based and SAS/EIS derived applications. More importantly, the warehouse is under the central control of a single administrator and refresh is scheduled in a manner consistent with the needs of the department using the Win",25p117.pdf

"Paper 120-25 Minimizing Development Risk While Maximizing Warehouse Performance on UNIX® Systems Jeff LeSueur, BMG Direct, New York, New York ABSTRACT:   Like many companies, BMG Direct is coping with business challenges which put pressure on sales, profitability and overhead. While a data warehouse represented considerable long term potential in developing incremental profit, it also represented a significant and immediate expense and risk. BMG management needed an approach which assured that development would be both successful and within budget. By adopting a low risk approach with management, which emphasized cost neutrality and a try before you buy test effort coordinated with SAS and IBM, initial funding was easily acquired to support a bench mark test of the warehouse hardware and software. Testing would confirm the design goals could be met, and would expose any unexpected risks. Since actual performance was nearly four times better than expectations, the project was approved with a high level of confidence. This paper focuses primarily on the design and test aspects of warehouse development and documents the activities and key items learned in the course of successfully developing a large (100GB), high performance data warehouse. IT managers and business managers should gain insight into system performance parameters available from UNIX based minicomputers, as well as low risk project management guidelines. BACKGROUND For several years all analytical activity at BMG was performed on either a production IBM S390 system, or one of two small (single processor) UNIX systems. Data on the mainframe was stored on 3490 magtape (2GB capacity). The production masterfile had grown to 19 such tapes, DASD storage for this large a file was simply unavailable, even sort space exceeding 1.5GB was normally unavailable. Production masterfile data was also routinely purged: older, inactive accounts were moved to another set of tapes, 15 or so comprising purged data from t",25p120.pdf

Wecker Associates, Inc., Novato, CA Woojeong Bang, Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center, Chicago, IL ABSTRACT Do you work in a research or production environment in which you must produce many reports or statistical analyses from multiple data sets? Are your data structures sufficiently complex that you want to create a system that provides easy access to the data in a logical manner? Do you have users of different levels of sophistication and who have different goals? We were faced with these tasks, plus we needed to create a system whose code would be robust to changes in the underlying data warehouse. In our research group we have several ongoing studies with data stored in relational databases, flat files, and spreadsheets, and there are dozens of active research projects. We created a common user interface for enterprise-wide access to data from all of these sources for all of the studies, using SAS/AF® FRAME entries and Screen Control Language. We have added features that allow us to quickly and easily review our data, produce reports, and access the full power of the SAS System, saving users considerable time. We will describe some of the particular design issues we faced, show the system we created, and discuss future developments.

"Financial information is vital for all departments of a company. Now that your company has successfully implemented SAP R/3, a vital question comes into all minds:  How to ensure that the business operations are working towards the strategic direction set by the board of management? The answer to this question is the Balanced Scorecard. The Balance scorecard is a management system that translates the mission and strategy of an organization into a coherent set of objectives and measures (See Ref.1). This paper will demonstrate the different steps to achieve the building of this powerful decision support system tool on top of SAP R/3 ERP system. First, we have to access the SAP R/3 financial data. The SAS/ACCESS® to SAP AG's R/3 tool combined with strong business knowledge of SAP AGs R/3 will be the key success factor to this step. Secondly, we have to build a powerful reporting tool to serve as a basis for the strategic analysis. For this, we integrate the SAP operational information with the SAS CFO Vision.

"    In data processing in general, and numerous aspects of Data Warehousing, in particular, searching is one of the most frequently performed operations. Base SAS offers a rich collection of built-in searching techniques. Merging and SQL joins, formats and SAS indexes - all serve the purpose of looking up relevant data. In addition, SAS Language incorporates arrays  the data structures ideal for implementing just about any searching algorithm. An arraybased lookup is not a ready-to-go recipe: It has to be hand-coded and tuned. However, this private detective approach is more flexible and may result in programs searching much faster and using fewer resources than the heavy artillery.    In this paper, SAS arrays are viewed as a DATA step structure ideally suited for quick data lookup based on the idea of direct addressing. Three such techniques - key-indexing, bitmapping, and hashing -  are considered in their logical sequence using a real-life example of matching data files by a common key. The results of benchmarking presented in the paper show that these methods beat even the fastest ready-to-use tools like popular large formats, by a wide margin. Thus, they can be indispensable in any massive data processing setting such as a Data Warehouse, where speed and efficiency considerations are paramount.",25p129.pdf
"Building a Data Mart on top of SAP R/3-HR Christ D'haeveloose Sophie Debaets SOLID PARTNERS N.V. Introduction In the field of human resources there is a growing trend towards moving from activity based functions to a more strategic, business oriented role. Nowadays a company wants to align its human asset management goals more closely to its corporate objectives. Therefore HR professionals need a sophisticated tool to understand their personnel by measuring for instance the employee satisfaction and analyse the impact of decisions about compensation policies, organisational structure, hiring and so on. A Data Mart focusing on the HR information needs is the best solution to meet these objectives. Purpose The purpose of this paper is to explain how the SAS System can be used on top of SAP R/3 HR, the Human Resource module of SAP A.G., to obtain real business benefits on a very short time. It is explained how one can easily implement a data extraction using SAS Access to SAP AG's R/3, integrate this information in a HR Data Mart and exploit its contents using SAS EIS.

"ry, NC ABSTRACT Version 8 of the SAS® System brings powerful new features for managing a Hybrid OLAP (HOLAP) or Distributed Multidimensional Data environment. The HOLAP component of the SAS/MDDB® Server software enables you to include SAS Multidimensional databases (MDDB), SAS files, and relational (RDBMS) databases into a single, powerful OLAP reporting environment.   Support for HOLAP data groups is fully integrated into a number of SAS Institutes OLAP solutions. INTRODUCTION In Version 6, the HOLAP extensions to SAS/EIS software have become a widely implemented back-end for OLAP reporting applications. In Version 8, SAS/MDDB Server software features the ability to access and retrieve multidimensional data stored in a variety of formats on local or remote servers. One logical MDDB can be stored in many different formats and locations. Working with distributed multidimensional data requires two facilities that are part of SAS/MDDB Server software: the Distributed Multidimensional Metadata (DMM) facility and the Multidimensional Data Provider (MDP). The DMM enables you to define logical MDDBs, while the MDP enables you to retrieve the data. These components include and extend the feature set of the Version 6 HOLAP Extensions. In addition, the HOLAP or MDP component is now fully integrated into a number of OLAP solutions offered by SAS Institute. WHAT IS OLAP?

"This paper will describe the data warehouse/decision support/data mining system that we have developed to improve disk drive manufacturing yields in the IBM Storage Technology Division. The data warehouse combines operational data from our disk, wafer and head stack processing plants. Data is extracted weekly, cleansed and correlated with the test results for the disk drives assembled from the corresponding components. The decision support system, based on SAS/IntrNet ® , provides OLAP capability for yield analysis. This system enables the user to compare yield loss rates, by failure code, component source, EC level, date of manufacture, etc. The system also shows the sensitivity of drive yield to each continuous in-line measurement, and predicts the yield improvement that would result from component process improvements. The yield sensitivity studies are also used to identify critical parameters for input to the data mining algorithms of SAS/Enterprise Miner ® . We use decision trees to identify combinations of parameters with unusually high or low yield, and neural networks to create multi-dimensional models of yield as a function of in-line measurements. This system allows us to quickly identify the factors causing yield loss, evaluate the cost/benefit of proposed changes, and operate our plants with optimal processes and specifications.",25p134.pdf
"y, Indianapolis, IN Abstract Warehouse technology amasses teradata as the basis for Decision Support Systems (DSS). Key to knowledge formation is the organization and representation of such data. Identification of data structures enables the selection of decision support models. Use of object-classes with warehouse metadata allows creation of analytic frameworks. We discuss the production application of object-based SAS analyses driven by warehouse metadata. Introduction In the current business climate, competitive advantage requires knowledge-based information delivery. The right information must be readily available for decision makers. Integral to information technology, Data Warehouses organize and maintain a steady stream of information. Welbrock (1998) defines Data Warehousing as  a process of fulfilling Decision Support enterprise needs through the availability of information using the key terms: Decision Support needs and availability of information. In the classical repository view (Sagar and Raval, 1999), warehouses exist primarily to organize input data for DSS. However, business decisions are typically based on condensed analytic results. Interpreting these results requires an understanding of how they were computed (application metadata). Welbrocks second term implies these metadata definitions must also be warehoused. DSS are often built using object-oriented (OO) methodology, where data is encapsulated in objects. Kolosova and Berestizhevsky (1998) desc",25p135.pdf

This paper will discuss our continuing efforts to provide open access to OLAP data via the SAS/MDDB Server software product. INTRODUCTION OLAP (Online Analytical Processing) products have historically used proprietary interfaces to transmit data between an OLAP server and an OLAP client. The introduction of Microsofts OLE DB for OLAP specification established an industry standard for OLAP data interchange. This allowed many different OLAP and multidimensional tools, both client and server, to work together for the first time. OLE DB for OLAP extended OLE DB by defining a set of objects and interfaces for accessing multidimensional data. In addition, it introduced a multidimensional query language, known as Multidimensional Expressions or MDX, which could be used to query data from an OLAP system.

"becomes increasingly more popular, guidelines for its efficient use are critical. Areas deserving special consideration include program execution, I/O, disk space, and program maintenance. A collection of techniques and sample code are presented to illustrate numerous practical techniques for gaining efficiency while using SAS Software. INTRODUCTION When developing SAS program code and/or applications, efficiency is not always given the attention it deserves, particularly in the early phases of development. System performance requirements can greatly affect the behavior an application exhibits. Active user participation is crucial to understanding application and performance requirements. Attention should be given to each individual program function to assess performance criteria. Understanding user expectations, (preferably during the early phases of the application development process) often results in a more efficient application. Consequently, the difficulty associated with improving efficiency as coding nears completion is often minimized. This paper highlights several areas where a program's performance can be improved when using SAS software. EFFICIENCY OBJECTIVES Efficiency objectives are best achieved when implemented as early as possible, preferably during the design phase. But when this is not possible, for example when customizing or inheriting an application, efficiency and performance techniques can still be ""applied"" to obtain some degree of improvement.

"ell SAS knows how to use PROC PRINT. Its primary use may be as a development tool to help in debugging a long multi-step program, or as a simple report generator when all that is really needed is a quick look at the data, or even a basic low-level finished report. However, if a report generation/information delivery tool with powerful formatting, summarizing and analysis features is called for, then PROC REPORT is the solution. PROC REPORT can provide the standard PROC PRINT functionality, but in addition, can easily perform many of the tasks that you would otherwise have to use the SORT, MEANS, FREQ and TABULATE procedures to accomplish. PROC REPORT is part of the Base SAS product, can run in both an interactive screen-painting mode or a batch mode, and should be the basic tool of choice when there is a need to produce powerful and productive reports from SAS data sets. This paper will present the basics of PROC REPORT (noninteractive mode) through a series of progressively more sophisticated examples of code and output. The main thrust behind PROC REPORT has been its interactive WYSIWYG ability, in which reports are designed online via screen painting manipulation of actual output. When the desired result is achieved, the design and structure of the report can be saved as a catalog entry and called up repeatedly for additional runs with new sets of data. The design can then be modified at any time, and can either be replaced or saved as an additional entry. This is all done",25p147.pdf
"rtsdale, NY ABSTRACT PROC REPORT will display data. Thats a given. That it is more powerful than the standard SAS * reporting tool PROC PRINT is also becoming common knowledge. But what can PROC REPORT really do? It is certainly more than a glorified PROC PRINT, but it does take some additional work beyond mastering some of the basics of the procedure before it can be used to produce output that can rival that of a serious DATA _NULL_ step. This paper will discuss the use of several customized macros which can work together with some PROC REPORT options, and standard SAS title and footnote statements, to make your PROC REPORT output really shine. The purpose of this paper is to provide some methods, through a progressive series of examples, to enhance the output created when using PROC REPORT. It is assumed that you know how to write a basic PROC REPORT program including COLUMN, DEFINE, COMPUTE, and BREAK portions of the syntax. It is also assumed you have some understanding of what a basic SAS MACRO can do and that parameters can be passed to the macros. Many of the styles discussed in this paper are preferences, but could be adapted to your individual likes and needs.

"using SAS in a university environment in 1972, I was very excited about how much SAS could help me. As I learned more and more and moved to the real world of the employeed I needed more flexibility in my reporting - PROC PRINT had some and PROC MEANS and FREQ had basically none. And SUMMARY needed too much DATA step manipulation. What I needed was a marriage of all these with the flexibility to control what I wanted where and how! Thank the Gods for PROC TABULATE!! I was able to produce reports from massive amounts of data in practically any way I needed! The power of being able to simply rearrange a few variable names and change the complete look of the report was great. But then I also found a few things that were not so simple-like percentages. BEFORE TABULATE So many times when you first learn some new software product, you simply do what you are told or can findout about it. I learned base SAS software the same way at a university from a friend. It was for some math classes and I learned to do some simple inputting and frequency tables and summaries using PROC FREQ and SUMMARY. It wasn't until years later I discovered the power of PROC TABULATE. If all you ever need to do is some simple cross-tabulations or simply print a list of summaries, PROC FREQ or MEANS or SUMMARY will do the job. But more often, you need to be able to control WHAT goes in the cross-tabulation cell and HOW it is printed; PROC TABULATE gives you this control and versatility.

There are many software ""tools"" that allow you create web pages without touching any HTML. You have to still correct the HTML editors' assumptions so you still have to become familiar with HTML. Also, if you are serious about doing more than a simple page or two, and want to further your knowledge as well as your market value, a solid footing in the basics will greatly accelerate what you can do and command. Simply stated, HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is a page layout language that tells a web browser how to display a web page. It doesnt even come close to being a programming language. Its rather simple for the most part. The documents themselves are plain text files with special ""tags"" or codes that a web browser knows how to interpret and display on your screen. Now that you know what HTML is, let's start using it. An HTML document contains two distinct parts: the head and the body. The head contains inf",25p154.pdf
"       The Time Series Forecasting System Charles Hallahan, Economic Research Service/USDA, Washington, DC INTRODUCTION The Time Series Forecasting System (TSFS) is a component of SAS/ETS ® that provides a menu-based front-end for forecasting activities. The tasks of creating a date variable, graphing a data series and quickly seeing the results of  differencing and/or applying a log transformation, testing for unit roots, examining autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots, performing seasonality tests, and, finally, estimating models and producing forecasts are just a mouse click away. This Hands-on Workshop is an introduction to the TSFS. Part 1 shows how to access the system and generate forecasting models for several variables through automatic selection from a default list of models provided with the TSFS. Part 2 shows how to override the defaults of the TSFS and take control of specifying a model. Part 3 shows how to add explanatory variables to the forecasting model and control the period of evaluation and fit of a model. This paper is written using the Developers version of SAS ® System Version 8. PART 1: USING THE TSFS IN AUTOMATIC MODE The first step is to make sure a libname statement has been executed to point to the directory containing the SAS data set to be analyzed. In the workshop, you will use SAS data sets found in the SASHELP directory. The TSFS can be accessed either through menu choices (see Figure 1) as Globals b Analyze b   Forecasting or by entering the command forecast on the command line or by assigning the command forecast to a function key. Figure 1 Accessing the TSFS You will be using two variables from the CITIMON SAS data set found in the SASHELP library. When the initial TSFS screen appears (see Figure 2), name the project SASUSER.TSFS.PROJ with a description of SUGI24 TSFS Hands-on Workshop: Part 1 (no quotes).

With this flexibility comes a complexity that often discourages a new user from taking the plunge and learning SAS/GRAPH. Learning and using SAS/GRAPH does not need to be difficult. Nor are the more complex aspects of SAS/GRAPH always needed to produce graphic output that is just what your boss wants. This workshop will introduce three of the primary procedures used by SAS/GRAPH, and introduce some of the options and statements that make them special. We will start with TITLEs and FOOTNOTEs. PROC GPLOT will be used to create a scatterplot which will be enhanced with SYMBOL statements and a number of options. A couple of variations of GCHART will be demonstrated and the creation of title slides using GSLIDE will be discussed briefly. Options specific to SAS/GRAPH and how and when they should be used will be handled with an introduction to  the GOPTIONS statement. KEY WORDS GOPTIONS, GPLOT, GCHART, SYMBOL, AXIS, TITLE, FOOTNOTE, OPTIONS GRAPHICS OPTIONS Options specific to the graphics environment are specified using the GOPTIONS statement in much the same way as the OPTIONS statement is used to specify system options.

This paper focuses on the Graph-N-Go * application in Version 8.0 of The SAS * System and the Graph tasks in Enterprise Guide Version 1.0. Using the point-and-click interfaces of these applications, you can visualize data quickly using a variety of chart and plot types and include your results into your documents and reports. INTRODUCTION In the past, it was necessary to write code to access the power of SAS/GRAPH * procedures like GCHART, GMAP, or GPLOT, but now much of the functionality in those procedures can be obtained through intuitive point-and-click interfaces. In Version 8.0 of the SAS System there are several ways of producing graphs quickly and easily. Because getting results is faster and easier, you can explore your data more readily and try alternative graphing techniques or chart types. Graphs are also more easily transferred to web pages or other documents than ever before they can be exported in many image formats. Results can be interactive or live when they are created as web pages using the SAS/GRAPH ActiveX Control or Graph Applet.

Slaughter, Independent Consultant, Davis, CA Introduction In the book The Phantom Tollbooth, a boy named Milo sees life as a waste of time. Then one day he is magically transported to the Kingdom of Wisdom. His journey starts in Expectations, then, without thinking, he finds himself in the Doldrums. During his travels, Milo meets many interesting and unusual characters, and learns about the Princess of Sweet Rhyme and the Princess of Pure Reason.   The princesses have been banished from the Kingdom, but Milo rescues them thereby restoring rhyme and reason to the Kingdom. And, in so doing, Milo finds meaning in his own life. When confronted with a large amount of data, and told to write a report, your journey will have many similarities to Milos journey through the Kingdom of Wisdom. You, and likely your boss, will start with some expectations about what the report will be like and what information it will convey. You may end up in the Doldrums, as Milo did, not knowing how to go about producing the report. Your journey will likely take many turns, and you will learn new things along the way. But, in the end, your goal is to bring rhyme and reason to your report thereby making sense out of your data. Expectations One of the interesting places Milo visits during his journey is the Word Market in the city of Dictionopolis.  You can buy any word you like at the Word Market, and they come in all shapes, sizes and flavors. Suppose you have been given sales data for several vendors at the market, and are expected to produce a nice report. Table 1 shows the data file in CSV (comma separated value) format.

"Paper 160-25 Not on the Menu..., Visualizing Application Path Choices Tom Miron, Miron InfoTec, Inc., Madison, WI Pick-List Menus (PMENU) The most common application interface is the picklist menu. Within the SAS system, these menus are called PMENUs and are usually created with PROC PMENU. PMENUs allow for menu hierarchies, that is, selecting a menu item can open another menu. PMENUs are used throughout the SAS Display Manager (DM) and are similar to the menu interface used with other graphical interface systems, including most Windows family applications. See Fig. 1. Within the SAS system, there is extensive support for PMENUs:  menus can be assigned with the frame general attribute screen. No coding and recompile are required to changed menus  PMENU related commands, functions, and methods are provided with the display manager, SCL, and SAS/AF classes  support for autoloading of TOOLBOXs related by name to PMENU entries (Windows platforms)  support for item gray/ungray, checkbox and radio button items  support for accelerator key combinations Whats the Issue? Hierarchical, pick-list menus have stood the test of time and are familiar to most application users, as such, they should get first consideration when designing an application interface. PMENUs are a good choice when your application paths are organized as a fixed hierarchy. There are situations were alternatives to PMENUs should be considered. First, PMENUs are unavoidably hierarchical. If this hierarchical view does not fit well with your application or data organization, PMENUs can be cumbersome and confusing. PMENUs also limit the users view of the application structure. Most of the time users are offered only a top-level view of the items on the menu bar. Sub-menu functions are only displayed when a menu bar item is selected. Essential, or at least useful, functions can be buried under layers of sub-menus. Users may not be aware of application features because they have not explored al",25p160.pdf

You can indeed make proximity- or location-based inferences or decisions, or discover and present the locational significance of whats hidden in your data warehouse, with tools you already have. Probably the most widely available SAS ® software product in the world, after Base SAS, is SAS/GRAPH ® . With PROC GMAP, its map data sets, and auxiliary PROCs and data, you can crea te what I like to call InfoGeographics, at no added cost. This paper introduces you to PROC GMAP, if you want to create maps from scratch.

"introduces the storage and retrieval of graphs in The SAS System. The audience will be shown how to store graphs in a catalog, how to retrieve the graph and print using PROC GREPLAY, and how to format the stored graph using templates. Interactive and noninteractive use of PROC GREPLAY will be covered. Libraries and Catalogs Graphs created in SAS/GRAPH will be stored in a SAS catalog. A SAS catalog is a SAS file that is used to store SAS specific objects, such as graphs, frames, macros, and formats. While a SAS library is simply a pointer to a directory or folder on the operating system, a catalog is simply one file within that library. This one file, though, can contain many different entries. Storing Graphs in a Catalog To create a SAS catalog containing a graph created in SAS/GRAPH, simply include the option GOUT=<libname>.<catname> in your PROC Gxxxx statement, where libname is the library name and catname is the catalog name. Please note the following: 1. If libname is not specified, then WORK is assumed. 2. If the GOUT option is not specified, then the graphics output is directed to the catalog WORK.GSEG. Optional: if you add the statement NAME='anything' to your graph statement options, where 'anything' is a descriptive name up to 8 characters long, your plot will be placed in the catalog with that descriptive name.

"Visualizing and presenting data effectively using reports and listings can be a difficult task. The SAS System® overcomes this difficulty by offering a wide variety of graphing capabilities with the SAS/Graph® module. Using the SAS System you can use graphs as a data exploration technique to see patterns, trends, and anomalies and you can present your data as graphs to make data easier to understand. But hey, writing code for those SAS/Graph procedures is not for everyone. There is now great news for those who do want graphs but do not want to write program code. SAS recently introduced Graph-N-Go, a completely interactive interface for making several types of graphs from your SAS data sets. I know it's a goofy name, but Graph-N-Go is anything but goofy.

However, the presentation of this information can become awkward and difficult when a programmer is faced with specific requirements that are not readily addressed in SAS/GRAPH. Specifications including the horizontal display of confidence intervals, a varying number of studies, and symbol size generation that is based on varying study populations, may all add to a challenging task. When first presented with this task, a programmer may be tempted to pursue other, more suitable software packages to graphically present the data.

"ammers who want to learn more about analyzing data using the 80/20 Principle. The principle states that most of your results come from a small proportion of your efforts. This paper will show readers how to look for, identify, and interpret data trends that support application of the 80/20 principle. INTRODUCTION The 80/20 principle states that in most systems, there are trivial many and vital few that affect the overall outcome. Some simple examples are: Business 20% of salespeople make 80% of sales 20% of investments make 80% of return Sports & Leisure 20% of at-bats make 80% of the hits 20% of movies make 80% of profits 20% of people at a picnic eat 80% of food Understand that this is rarely a literal 80/20 split but is used as a rule of thumb to get the concept across. The 80/20 rule is valuable in businessmore valuable than most people think. This rule has can be applied to quickly and easily make decisions that can have tremendous impact on end results. The 80/20 Principle states that most results come from a small proportion of efforts. Other common names for the 80/20 rule are: The Rule of the Vital Few The Pareto Principle The Peter Principle HOW TO APPLY THE 80/20 PRINCIPLE The SAS/QC product has a nice little procedure called PROC PARETO.

"Paper 171-25 Dead Graphs -- RIP (How Interactive Graphical EDA Techniques Can Markedly Enhance the Analysis/Display of Our Data) Dave DesJardins, Statistical Research Division, U.S. Bureau of the Census Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to highlight the important difference between ""dead"" graphs and ""live"" graphs. With live graphs, users can dynamically change the display of their information based on a quick, interactive cross tabbing of the underlying/input data. These live graphs will be a key component of a Census Historical Atlas CDROM that is to be published by the Census Bureau next year. With ""live"" graphs, we hope to bring an incredible capability to the general public -- to gain a quantum leap in our ability to see and understand our data. The concept of this new data display technology is based on the existing, new, and very powerful interactive graphics software packages that have already revolutionized the statistical analysis of our data. These packages create ""live"" graphs -- which are the fundamental building blocks of a new interactive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) methodology course currently being taught on an ongoing basis by the author. This methodology is based on easy-to-learn 3 rd generation point-and-click software tools (SAS/Insight * and JMP * ). Using this software, the author has devised an ""EDA Plan of Attack"" that has become a key component of the interactive techniques of his courses. The plan of attack is likened to a battlefield strategy used by the military -- wherein the unique strengths and weaknesses of planes, tanks, and artillery (tools) are used in combination with a practiced strategy (techniques) to gain an objective. Using powerful, newly developed live graphs, this EDA strategy has been devised to reveal the hidden features of our data. Thus, it uses a combination of the best features of a number of types of graphs (the tools: box plots, scatterplots, data profile plots, etc.) -- in combination with the interactive",25p171.pdf

"nia Chapman Gleason, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Washington, DC ABSTRACT Combining new features from the Output Delivery System (ODS) and SAS/Graph in Version 8, it is possible to create static drillable maps, not only hyper-linked for each region but also for annotated geographical points. We further developed techniques to send the resulting image and HTML file directly to the Internet, achieving dynamic drillable maps. INTRODUCTION We have always wanted to present an U.S. map, showing a metric, say income, of all fifty states. The user clicks on a state then more information about that state is shown, perhaps a state map of counties showing each countys measurement plus other relevant textual reports. Larry Hoyle had developed a Java program for making drillable maps (Ref 1). By using products from Environmental Science Research Institute , Myles Powers developed drillable map with zoom-in, zoom-out, and other features (Ref 2) for display over the Internet. Before Version 7, SAS provided a macro program for translating a map dataset into HTML AREA tag statement. However this macro program must be run in two phases, as such, it is static and not dynamic (Ref 3). ODS readily supports drillable action in Proc Gmap, Gchart, and Gplot. There are sample programs on SAS Technical Support web site (Ref 4) and SUGI papers (Ref 5) illustrating how to make a bar or pie chart, or legend in a graph drillable. These samples showed how to pre-generate static HTML files. Here w",25p178.pdf

"ional Genetic Epidemiology Society meeting used software developed with the SAS System for registration and abstract management. Given the international nature of the presenters and attendees, however, conducting the routine business associated with these tasks by telephone or postal service would quickly get expensive. To reduce administrative costs, the organizers wanted to use electronic mail as the primary approach for confirming registration and abstract submission. It was also the preferred method of notifying presenters of their acceptance, and to give them the time and date of their presentation. The SAS System electronic mail interface not only fulfilled these requirements, it did so in a seamless, integrated fashion requiring no additional training or user intervention. Why IGES '99 Chose The SAS System The original decision to use the SAS System for registration and abstract management was based on the existence of similar in-house software. This software had been developed for the 1998 MidWest SAS Users Group conference. Registration confirmation in the original software was handled via printed letters mailed to registrants. The letters were produced using a macro library that generated PostScript code 1 , which was then sent to a network printer.

The method presented here creates a series of web-capable displays. For simplicity, we concentrate on 2-level layout: the main page and the child pages. The main page has an embedded interactive graph: when the mouse is paused over a point on the graph, a window pops-up with some information about the point. If user clicks on the point, a child page is displayed. This is accomplished via SAS macro, which creates an HTML document with embedded JavaScript. The child pages can contain graphics (created via SAS/GRAPH ) or text (output from SAS procedures). The appearance of child pages can be enhanced if they are produced in HTML format, either via SAS macro or using ODS feature of SAS 7 or 8.  The intended audience should have at least some familiarity with SAS GRAPH software.",25p186.pdf
"This paper describes the use of SAS/IntrNet TM software to develop a health information query system available to the public via the web. The Office of Research and Statistics(ORS), collects various health and demographic data. These data include hospitalizations, census and numerous other data. ORS undertook the challenge to condense much of its data and make it available to the public via the web using SAS and SAS/IntrNet TM software. The data were summarized by selected categories and a query system was designed using SAS/IntrNet TM software, SAS web publishing tools and HTML forms. The use of SAS and SAS/IntrNet TM software allowed ORS to condense its data and make it readily available via the web. ORS receives numerous requests from various sources. Using the query system, requestors may obtain needed information in minutes instead of days. The SAS query system has helped numerous people receive information expediently and has also allowed our staff to pursue other pertinent projects. Overall, the development of a query system using SAS/IntrNet TM software has been an asset to ORS.",25p187.pdf
"The purpose of this project was to develop a system to enter, store, retrieve, analyze and report data entirely over the Internet. The selected approach merged the Netscape Enterprise Servers capability to create applications using client-side and server-side JavaScript with the statistical processing features of SAS through the web-based software: SAS IntrNet. The application was designed to collect measures of physical health for a cohort of undergraduate students. The measures were first processed on the client-side to provide personal feedback. A request link enabled the client to send their measures to the server using server-side JavaScript write commands. The data were appended to a storage data set comprised of responses from visitors that agreed to submit their data. SAS programs were written to provide descriptive statistics and tests of inference for the data set. A menu of available SAS programs was posted on the homepage web-site. Selecting a specific hot link, users could invoke a particular SAS program to analyze the data set. Each SAS program produced an output file that was posted to the Internet for the user to review. The results could then be compared to normative values available through the homepage menu of the web-site.",25p189.pdf
One of our primary goals for credit policy is to establish criteria which select applicants that have the highest probability of repaying their loans to our company. These criteria rely on models developed using information from loan applications (such as income and homeownership) and from our experience with them as customers (whether they paid as agreed). One of the first steps in the model development process involves sampling relevant data and classifying the accounts based on performance (payment history). Customers frequently renew and refinance loans within the sample period and it is important to track the performance of these customers from one loan to the next. Matching the old loan with the subsequent loan becomes difficult because the closing of one loan and the opening of the next loan can occur several days apart and the customer may have additional loans open with the company. Simple match-merge techniques will not work because there are not common values of a key variable for matching between the two accounts. The purpose of this paper is to explain how to use a fuzzy merge to match the old loan with the subsequent loan in order to combine the performance data between the two accounts.,25p190.pdf

"Paper 193-25 SAS ® USER SUPPORT AND THE INTRANET: WEB PAGES, IN-HOUSE DOCUMENTATION, AND SAMPLE LIBRARY Bruce Gilsen, Federal Reserve Board Scott Hoenig, Federal Reserve Board INTRODUCTION The SAS ® system is used at the Federal Reserve Board on the MVS ®, UNIX, and PC platforms for tasks ranging from data processing applications to econometric research. The Board's in-house SAS consulting group, comprised of one full-time and two part-time consultants, provides SAS support at the Board, including installation, testing, and cutover of SAS software; technical consulting via telephone hotline, e-mail, and office visits; and manual distribution. In 1998, over 800 users executed the SAS system on Board computers, and 1250 requests for technical assistance and 350 requests for documentation and SAS training information were received. In the last few years, the Board's intranet, FedWeb, has become an important component of the Board's operating environment. This paper describes how FedWeb has been used to improve SAS support at the Board. The following topics are discussed. 1. The SAS consulting web pages on FedWeb. 2. In-house SAS documentation on FedWeb. 3. In-house SAS sample library on FedWeb. 4. SAS Tips articles in the Information Exchange . Also discussed are some issues that were considered as the web pages were developed, such as the following. 1. Should large web documents be stored in one HTML file or multiple HTML files? What type of printed table of contents, if any, should be generated for a web document displayed without page numbers in a browser? 2. How should online sample programs be formatted? How much HTML, if any, should they contain? SAS CONSULTING PAGES ON FEDWEB The SAS consulting web pages were first added to FedWeb in January 1996. The SAS consulting home page, shown in Figure 1, contains links to the other SAS consulting web pages, some of which are discussed elsewhere in the paper.

"at your SASLOG."" You hear it from instructors of courses related to the SAS ® System. You read it in papers that are published in the Proceedings of SESUG and other similar conferences. But they never seem to address the next obvious issue - ""Then what?"" What should you be looking for? And what should you do if you find it? This presentation will look at one message that is often found in the SASLOG: NOTE: MERGE statement has more than one data set with repeats of       BY values. We will discuss - and quickly discount - a ""bandage"" approach that will stop the message from being displayed. More importantly, we will discuss the creation of an ad-hoc routine that will help you understand why the message occurred, and how to revise your code to prevent its recurrence. MERGE Statement: Repeats of BY Values Most users of the SAS system have encountered the following message: NOTE: MERGE statement has more than one data set with repeats of       BY values. There are many papers in the Proceedings from past SUGI, SESUG, and the other various regional SAS User Group conferences that describe how to programatically force such a merge to occur. This assumes that the user wants to merge datasets that have repeats of BY values. However, it is also possible that the user did not expect this condition. This implies an error in your SAS routine, caused by a misunderstanding of the input data. We want to isolate these cases and modify our assumptions, so that we can correct our MERGE and eli",25p194.pdf
"Windows operating system doesnt allow multiple users to update the same SAS data set in the same time, however in the real life it is very often that several users need the right to update the same SAS data set in the same time. For instance, several people enter data into the same SAS data set in the same time; everyone needs the right to update the same data set. This paper is mainly to present an idea to solve this problem and make Windows to allow multiple users to access even update the same SAS data set.",25p195.pdf
"In spite of gathering requirements and developing many production reports, developers are often asked to drop everything in order to produce an ad hoc report for upper management. The continuing occurrence of these requests causes the developers to become extremely frustrated, especially if the time lines on current projects are still expected to be met. A tool that can help solve this problem is an ad hoc query tool on the Web. With the requirement by U S WEST users that applications be on the companys intranet, SAS/INTRNET is used to develop a tool that will allow many of these requests to be accomplished by the users themselves. In order for the tool to be successful, well thought-out data marts must be in place. The data marts must not only contain detail data sets, but summarized data sets that are grouped by all possible categories and combinations of categories. Date variables are also designated so that they can be used for the timeframes that the users want. This information is stored in SAS data sets that are used by the tool to let the user generate the report. Each report has the capability to download the data directly to EXCEL on the desktop, thus allowing the firedrill to be handled without taking valuable time from the developers.",25p196.pdf
"INTO: host-variable in PROC SQL is a powerful tool. It simplifies programming code while minimizing the risk of typographical errors. SQL INTO: creates one or more macro variables, based on the results of a SELECT statement. This macro variable(s) reflects a list of values that can then be used to manipulate data in both DATA and PROC steps. The usefulness of SQL INTO: will be demonstrated by analyzing a large medical claims database. Keywords: INTO:, host-variable, macro, SQL Introduction The INTO: host-variable in PROC SQL is a valuable resource for creating a macro variable made up of values. It overcomes several limitations in hard coding values, including the possibility of typographical errors, resource constraints, and does not account for dynamic data. Previous presentations have explored the application and utility of this hostvariable (1-2). The purpose of this presentation is to review previously covered, as well as to introduce new forms and applications of the INTO: host-variable to address common business needs. Variations of the INTO: Host-Variable Prior to the Release 6.11, the INTO: host-variable simply stored the first row of values (3). For example, the host-variable in Listing 1 that refers to the sample data in Listing 2 would store the following: P01   53071 . Listing 1.  Release 6.06 form of the INTO: host-variable. 1.

"ABSTRACT The ANNOTATE facility is a useful tool that adds to the capabilities of SAS/GRAPH® and related procedures. We will briefly examine some of the common uses and expound on some of the more advanced uses of annotate. KEY WORDS ANNOTATE, macro, annomac, SAS/GRAPH. INTRODUCTION The ANNOTATE facility is a tool within SAS/GRAPH that extends its power to create customized modifications of graphical output. It can be used with the following SAS/GRAPH procedures: GANNO, GCHART, GCONTOUR, GMAP, GPLOT, GPRINT, GSLIDE, and G3D. We will refer of the ANNOTATE facility in the following text simply as ANNOTATE. This poster presentation does not attempt to explain the details needed to program with ANNOTATE, but simply show examples of its use and possibly expand the reader's view of the power of ANNOTATE. We have listed a selection of references at the end that will give the reader more details about how to program with ANNOTATE. Additionally, look for modules on the subject in the series of monographs edited by Art Carpenter. His first monograph, Annotate: Simply the Basics (Carpenter, 1999), is an introduction to Annotate. ANNOTATE is most commonly used to add labels or values to points on a graph, to add labels and values to the histogram bar charts, or place a special symbol or text at specific locations. These modifications were used by the authors many years ago when they first began using ANNOTATE. As experience grew, the capabilities of ANNOTATE became more apparent. More advanced uses include 1.) the creation of a second horizontal axis or a customized axis on graphs or charts; 2.) creation of complex graphical representations such as current vector plots or compass roses; 3.) creation of libraries of ANNOTATE features, symbols, or polygons which can be quickly added to maps; and 4.) the creation of complex figures that can be placed at multiple locations on an ANNOTATE map which display information specific to that location. Another advanced feature is the ANNOTAT",25p199.pdf
"CA ABSTRACT Business can take advantage of all the features of the SAS System. By taking a task-oriented approach to address business issues, SAS programs can be written to support the functional requirements of business operations. The objective of many companies is to establish a data warehouse structure that incorporates total customer involvement with standards and documentation. The four main areas that will be reviewed include data access, data management, data analysis and data presentation. Critical business decisions will benefit from these structured approaches. DATA ACCESS The first requirement for all businesses to manage information is to access the data. Typically in large companies, data files are stored and updated in a variety of formats. SAS procedures can access these files directly and also create a SAS view or a SAS data set based on these external files. Examples of these external files include Informix and Oracle. In addition, SAS programs can be written to read the contents of a Microsoft Excel file. For applications that collect data, a SAS Data Entry System can be created. Question 1 - What is an effective procedure used to access external files for SAS data set creation? Answer 1 - The Proc SQL procedure . The SAS code below shows how a few statements of the Proc SQL can be used to create a SAS data set from an Informix database. While no subsetting is performed in this example, the user has great flexibility to subset and organize the data to fit t",25p200.pdf

Evans, Rochester, MN ABSTRACT A historical Cost/Utilization Data Warehouse developed in SAS® provides Health Services Evaluation researchers with valuable data for analysis. All medical and hospital services provided at the Mayo Clinic and all services provided in Olmsted County from 1987 to 1998 currently populate the warehouse. The volume of data that is now available created some interesting challenges. Distribution of the metadata was needed as well as the mapping of data elements to terms the target audience understood. The need to provide the client with an interface to access the reference tables containing coding system descriptions, coding translations, and costing procedures through the same web interface was recognized. Creating a streamline process for data retrieval permitted the inclusion of a system to log the retrievals for documentation and security. Standardized analysis, reports and relevant metadata are consistently provided in conjunction with the detailed data retrieval. Lastly we determined that it was desirable to provide a feedback mechanism to share experiences using the data. Pitfalls and successes would be shared along with publications of the usefulness of the data.   The resolution of the previously mentioned issues was found in providing web interfaces on o",25p201.pdf
"The value of the efforts put into developing a data warehouse, or analytical applications, first show when the users get the information they need, presented in an understandable format.

This paper will focus on how to make the integration seamless for the users, and how the data warehouse administrator can manage the process from the data warehouse environment, not how to design reports. It is aimed at an audience of SAS programmers with limited knowledge of Enterprise Reporter release 2.5. Topics covered include  enhanced integration with SAS/Warehouse Administrator software version 2.0 and SAS application development tools  the Enterprise Reporter batch language and Batch Builder  availability of business specific sample reports ( IT-service level reporting and SAP R/3 reporting)  a look into the future enterprise reporting world.

"erous task any SAS programming professional faces is to accurately document files and processes. By setting careful standards at the outset of a programming task and using the many tools the SAS® system provides to assist in the documentation process, document files and processes need not be ""the dreaded D word"". WHY DOCUMENT? Documenting files and processes is important for a number of reasons. First, most organizations have a system that ensures quality products. Such a system may include a third party attempting to replicate results, reviewing code, etc. To facilitate a review of a SAS programmers product, it is useful to be able to provide accurate and clear documentation of both data files produced and utilized, and the SAS programs that create and analyze data. Secondly, many programmers reuse code and/or data files over months and years. Well-documented files (code and data) are easier to review for subsequent use, particularly if the version of SAS at a given site has changed over time (or if you have changed sites and taken your code with you!), and for Y2K compliance issues. Last but not least, it may be necessary to repeat certain operations in the event of a disk crash, media failure or other such calamity. Of course, we all have timed backups at least once a day so that shouldnt be a problem, but . . . it is much easier to reproduce files and operations with accurate documentation.

"A SAS® macro for comparing two slope estimates using a randomization test is presented. A milking practice evaluation score was obtained for 55 Dairy Herd Improvement Association (DHIA) dairies. The category for general sanitation practices consisted of obtaining the total score for four questions. The median score over all dairy responses was used to provide a cutoff point in order to discriminate each dairys response. Responses were recorded as being either below the median or above/equal to the median. Somatic Cell Count (SCC) data were also obtained for the dairies. The SCC values are an indicator to whether a cow has good or poor udder health. These counts were used as the dependent variable to examine the relationship between SCC and general sanitation for the two groups. Models were fit for each of the two groups and the slopes of the two models compared. A randomization test was constructed to examine whether or not the two slopes differed significantly from one another. This macro requires base SAS, SAS/STAT and SAS/GRAPH software to run.",25p205.pdf
"he Federal Reserve Board (FRB) when a new or maintenance release of UNIX SAS is available. To decide whether to replace the production release with a newer release appears to be a trivial decision. However, this paper shows that the decision is influenced by many factors. Changing the production release is time consuming for those who install SAS and maintain SAS documentation as well as an inconvenience for SAS users. For some releases compatibility and data conversion issues arise. A new release usually requires extra disk space which could be difficult to obtain and require the intervention of others. This paper has two purposes. The first is to document the steps taken when a new SAS release is available. This document can then be used as a guide to handle future releases. Second, while no other SAS site is exactly like this one, the information in this paper might help other SAS sites decide how to handle a new release. Most SAS users on any operating system should understand most of this paper. STEPS TAKEN Suppose a new or maintenance release of UNIX SAS is made available by SAS Institute. The following procedures are followed at the FRB. Step 1. Investigate the new release. First, a report which describes the new capabilities available in the new release is written.

"ement for Medical Statistics, University of Vienna, Austria Abstract In this presentation a graphical technique to check agreement visually is discussed. Emphasis is laid on how this statistical method can be performed within the SAS System. Data from clinical trials are presented. SAS code is reported using the following tools: Base SAS Software, PROC GPLOT and the Macro Language . Introduction Measurement in medical studies is very often an imprecise task and the errors associated with this should be quantified and understood. Since measurement error can seriously affect statistical analyses and interpretation, it is important to assess the amount of such an error . To investigate agreement in continuous variables a graphical technique proposed by Bland and Altman (1986) and the intraclass correlation coefficient are used. For categorial data the -measure is appropriate. Studies comparing two or more methods are common. The aim of these studies is to see if the methods agree well enough for one method to replace the others or for the methods to be used interchangeably. The same considerations apply to studies comparing two or more observers using one method. An important aspect of method or observer comparison is the comparison of the repeatability of each observer or method. Graphical Technique The inter-observer (within observer or between methods) agreement is demonstrated by a graphical technique suggested by Bland and Altman (Lancet, Feb. 8, 1989). In order to assess",25p207.pdf

Options for creating the legend are provided in this paper. Using the LEGEND statement requires an extraneous plot be hidden, thus providing information for the legend. This option is useful if you can hide a symbol within a symbol (i.e., dashed line and solid line or circle and dot). Another option is to use the FOOTNOTE statement to simulate a legend. For this option to work, symbols used in the graph must be reproduced in the footnote legend.",25p208.pdf

"Deploying the SAS System to a large number of Windows clients can be time consuming and costly, and often results in a system that is difficult to maintain. However, by deploying the SAS System using Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition, it is possible to install and configure the SAS System only once, and to have it immediately available to all clients on the network. The installation of maintenance releases and service packs are also performed only once, further reducing the costs of deployment. In addition, Terminal Server can provide all SAS users on your network with access to the latest release of the SAS System running on a fast and reliable Windows NT system, even if the clients themselves are still running older operating systems such as Windows 95 or Windows for Workgroups. This paper will describe the process of deploying the SAS System under the Windows NT Server 4.0, Terminal Server Edition operating system, including sizing and configuration of the server, installation and configuration of the SAS System, and performance tuning.",25p214.pdf
mart building process entails mapping data fields from the Oracle * database into SAS datasets based on mapping specifications. The data mart mapping specifications are held in Microsoft * Excel spreadsheets. This paper describes an automated approach to building an attribute dictionary and the code to assign the attributes to the datasets during the data mart building process. The approach includes two steps. The first step uses a nested SAS program with SAS macros to read the dataset specification from Excel worksheets and build an attribute dictionary that is transported to UNIX. The second step uses a SAS macro to assign the attributes to the data mart data sets within the mapping programs. The outcome is an attribute dictionary in the form of a SAS dataset and a SAS macro that can be invoked within the mapping programs to assign the attributes to the reporting datasets. The SAS product used in this paper is SAS BASE * on PC and UNIX platforms. SECTION 1: INTRODUCTION SmithKline Beecham (SB) Pharmaceuticals conducts clinical trials.

"A national agenda in education currently gaining popularity is the use of accountability models to evaluate public schools. A result of this movement has been the identification of a systemic problem with management of educational data in local schools. Most accountability programs have identified several variables as important indicators of academic performance for inclusion in models designed for public schools. The use of this data has necessitated an examination of the aggregation, storage, and analysis of data maintained by schools, culminating with the identification of a plethora of data management and analysis problems. A typical obstacle in obtaining this data is the lack of a consistent management forum for the aggregation and storage of different types of educational data collected in public schools. The most common mechanisms used are packages like EXCEL or DBASE IV. This paper demonstrates techniques for transitioning data from database packages to data management in SAS and use of appropriate ® statistical procedures to enhance data aggregation, storage, analysis, and reporting for use in accountability programs. A novice user of SAS ® with a personal computer and knowledge of BASE SAS will be able to complete the ® procedures demonstrated in this paper.",25p216.pdf

Because of their robustness properties, these indices are frequently more appropriate than the conventional parametric indices such as Cohens d or Hedges g . Additionally, a program that uses these effect size indices in robust permutation tests for betweenclass homogeneity (a test frequently used in metaanalysis) is introduced.

"Oftentimes in epidemiological research, we deal with case-control or simple cohort studies in which the exposures have more than two levels (i.e., we are looking at an exposure by outcome table that is rx2 ).   However, the CMH option in PROC FREQ will compute the estimates of risk for only 2x2 tables, and not for the more general rx2 tables. Data sets are created for each comparison against the referent exposure group, and PROC FREQs are run on these individual data sets. The PROC FREQ then is re-run for the entire rx2 table to obtain the estimate of the overall linear association. This can become quite a tedious undertaking very quickly. In this paper, we present macro code that automates the creation of the separate data sets and the subsequent PROC FREQs, and summarizes the cell counts and statistics of interest in an easily interpretable table for the client. The macro is written to allow use with any data set containing dichotomous outcome variables and multi-level exposure variables within any operating system.   Although the macro code is advanced, use is not limited to advanced users, but, rather, to those who have additional statistical reporting needs.",25p218.pdf

If you use VMS on a VAX you have such a utility, but apparently it has to be reinvented for PC SAS users. Such a utility is described here here for any users of BASE SAS® on a PC.. The target line and some lines before and after can be displayed as well to help see the context in which it is used. The name of each file found and the date of last modification is also given. The results can be saved in a file or displayed on the screen. An application can be extracting current program documentation from information stored within each of your programs into a documentation file at the end of a project. Another can be the locating of all invocations of a macro before modifying it.",25p219.pdf
"SAS® programmers do so coming from a statistics or computer science program. Many times neither does a good enough job at teaching the fundamentals of SAS programming. Computer science programs typically teach lower level languages such as C++ and statistics programs focus more on statistical theory and analysis. The introduction of SAS programming gets left up to industry. Over the past few years more and more colleges have been implementing SAS programming courses which is helping tremendously. INTRODUCTION This paper will try to outline areas to which people lack exposure when starting as an entry level SAS programmer. A BIG PICTURE UNDERSTANDING OF SAS SAS has grown to be much more than just a statistical package. Knowing how SAS compares to other software packages and what components make up SAS can help one become a better programmer or consultant. Understanding the different functions of SAS and the competitors in those areas can be beneficial. AN EXPLANATION OF HOW A SAS PROGRAM COMPILES AND EXECUTES This is a topic that really helps one understand how SAS is different from lower level languages. Realizing that SAS is an interpreted language compiled and executed in small chunks is a fundamental concept in SAS. Those chunks consist of global statements, data steps, or procedures. Explaining how SAS programs work with and without macro is especially helpful. There are some good diagrams in the SAS Macro Language Reference manual. Consider the following code. data _null",25p220.pdf

DELETING DUPLICATES It is often useful in SAS programming to delete duplicate records from a data set. PROC SORT has an option which seems designed to handle this problem, NODUPLICATES. THE NODUPLICATES OPTION According to the SAS Procedures Guide, Version 6, PROC SORT with the NODUPLICATES option checks for and eliminates duplicate observations. THE PROBLEM WITH NODUPLICATES So NODUPLICATES sounds like exactly what you need. Unfortunately, theres some fine print. A bit later, the SAS Procedures Guide says: This option causes PROC SORT to compare all variable values for each observation to the previous one written to the output data set. If an exact match is found, the observation is not written to the output data set. In other words, the documentation doesnt say that duplicates will be deleted  it says that adjacent duplicates will be deleted. Might you ever have nonadjacent duplicates? Yes, as an example will show. NON-ADJACENT DUPLICATES  EXAMPLE 1 Consider the f",25p221.pdf

This idea is for you! HOW IT WORKS THE CODE (EXAMPLE) Simply put, you have two set statements. The first one is encountered only on the first record (if _n_=1) and is for the data set of one recordin the example, AVGSALES. The second is the main dataset that you want to add the one observation of the first on to every observationin the example, TOTSALES. data national;       if _n_=1 then set avgsales;       set totsales; run; There is a real good description of this example in the SAS Language Guide (Reference ) Version 6 First Edition on page 487.

"Have you ever worked hard to produce a good printed report, only to find out that your client wanted to rework the numbers?   When I produce ad hoc reports from a medical claims database, I am constantly confronted with this problem.   Everyone has ideas of appropriate number groupings and report styles. Using the dynamic data exchange ability of a Microsoft Windows NT environment, I developed a SAS macro to solve this problem.   The macro transfers a SAS data set into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. This method allows the total control of your data that the SAS system offers, but provides your client with a report that they can customize.    The exact construction of this macro, along with its limitations and uses, will be detailed. BACKGROUND Rochester Community Individual Practice Association is a large organization composed of over 2,000 physicians and other healthcare providers.   We act as a contracting agent for these doctors with a local HMO and we also offer our own health insurance products.   We have about 100,000 covered lives for which we receive the claims records for each month. These data, combined with various supporting medical files and our physicians list, are read into the SAS system to create our healthcare database. From this database, a variety of reports with a standard form and format are generated every month. Supplementing these is a large number of reports requested to fill a particular need. The form of these reports is variable and is often used only once.",25p224.pdf
"In large observational studies there are often significant differences between characteristics of a treatment group and a no treatment group. Such differences should not exist in a randomized trial. These differences must be adjusted for in order to reduce treatment selection bias and determine treatment effect. There are several methods to reduce the bias of these differences and make the two groups more similar. One method is to perform analyses after matching cases (members of the treatment group) to controls (members of the no treatment group) based on a number of individual characteristics.    A refinement of this method is to create a propensity score to represent the relationship between multiple characteristics and an outcome as a single score, and then match on that single score. This paper will show SAS users how to create a propensity score using the LOGISTIC procedure and then match cases to controls based on this score with a user-written SAS macro program. The results of using the presented code, run on a large observational database of myocardial infarction patients, will be given as an example.",25p225.pdf

With more businesses becoming dependent on their network infrastructure, the need for proactive network diagnostic analysis is becoming a necessity. Network problems and outages have devastating impacts to businesses. The methods of collecting and analyzing network data continue to be an integral part of maintaining network harmony. This paper describes a method for analyzing Network Management data including the building of an Information Warehouse, data interrogation, and report presentation via the Web. Sharing this data with network administrators and technicians has saved IBM time and money and has helped turn reactive network maintenance into proactive network monitoring.

"NH ABSTRACT GenHTML is a library of macro functions that allow users to easily generate HTML tables from SAS® datasets. The library is ideal for producing static pages, but is also fast enough to produce dynamic pages when called from a CGI script. The library is freely available at http://www.dartmouth.edu/~bburnham and is distributed with the hope that users will continue development of the library and share their contributions. INTRODUCTION GenHTML was developed to meet three requirements. First, the library had to produce HTML tables. This allows end users of our web site to retrieve their web queries either as tables or as Microsoft Excel® spreadsheets. Since Excel® can translate HTML tables and maintain their formatting, we were able to implement the option of directing queries to either Excel® or web browsers by changing only one line of code in the HTTP header. The second requirement was that the routines needed to preserve as much of the format of the SAS® data as possible. For example, the library looks at whether the contents of a cell should be left or right justified depending on the format of the variable in the dataset. The final design goal was to allow users to set constants for certain formatting values (e.g. the color of a table or the width of the table's border) so that all tables generated from the library adhered to a defined style. The library was developed using SAS® 6.12 and does not require any products beyond BASE SAS®. Beginning SAS programmers s",25p232.pdf
"Abstract Abstract Abstract Cinema in the United States is a multi-billion dollar annual business which exhibits a strong seasonal pattern. In order to insure that their films have a high probability of success, film companies must have knowledge of competitive film openings as well as the size of their potential audience. An important aspect of deriving this information is the ability to   model monthly seasonal components of the time series. The SAS procedure, PROC X11 provides the software tool to achieve this goal. This paper illustrates how PROC X11 may be used to detect seasonal patterns in the time series for United States Domestic Box Office Revenue. The study uses the ARIMA option of PROC X11 as well as the new technique of sliding spans analysis.",25p233.pdf
"Paper 234-25 Using KEY= to Perform Table Look-up Sandra Lynn Aker, ASG, Inc., Vernon Hills, IL Introduction This paper demonstrates the use of indexes to perform table look-up, the process of locating observations in a table file based on values in a master file. It begins by discussing how this is done with the traditional MATCH-MERGE, including a demonstration of tips and tricks for handling matches and nonmatches. It then compares several different techniques used to create an INDEX, explaining both the simple and composite, and shows how to use them in a MATCH-MERGE, and then in a KEY READ with the KEY= data set option. It explains the _IORC_ and _ERROR_ automatic variables and discusses how to use these to make the process more efficient. It continues with demonstrations of different ways to access a table, especially when the key values are not unique on either the table or the master file, and also shows how to process nonmatches accurately. It concludes with a demonstration of how to use a KEY READ to modify data sets, and finally, a discussion of the overall advantages and disadvantages of using indexes. Simple Merge This is the standard technique for comparing values where data is read from a data set, or from an external flat file, sorted by any number of variables, and merged by those same variables. Note that the ability to flag the data set from which the match occurs using the IN operator, allows data manipulation contingent on the match/nonmatch DATA MASTER; SET SASDATA.MASTER (KEEP=DEPT ITEM SALES); DATA TABLE; INFILE FILEDATA; INPUT @1 DEPT 2.   @30 PERCENT 4.1; PROC SORT DATA=MASTER; BY DEPT; PROC SORT DATA=TABLE; BY DEPT; DATA MERGE; MERGE MASTER TABLE; BY DEPT; Merge with Output of Nonmatches Using PROC PRINTO Note in this example that the first PROC PRINTO designates a new output file where the nonmatches are printed, and the second PROC PRINTO returns printing to the standard output file.

"The enterprise today requires many applications (from multiple vendors) concurrently running in parallel on multiple platforms. Managing these applications and the resources these applications require sharing data and meta-data across the enterprise, and integrating these applications for cross functionality has been until recently intractable. This is due to reasons such as inherent differences in functionality, differences in program languages, lack of standard communication methods. With the advent of CORBA, JAVA and Enterprise Application Integration frameworks, these issues are beginning to be addressed with some success. This paper presents an Enterprise Application Integration framework based on an N-tiered, distributed, O-O architecture and allows for the development, testing and deployment of custom applications as well as for application integration of third party products. Five unique architectures are introduced within this framework. When operating together these architectures provide a complete mechanism for application integration that is scalable, extensible, and robust. In addition, it is shown how various SAS products such as SAS Warehouse Administrator, Data Miner, Enterprise Reporter, STAT, Graph, BASE, CONNECT, SHARE, ACCESS, EIS, and SAS AF can be incorporated into different components of the framework.

"We all know the world is not flat, but many researchers continue to model their world as a linear system. Many systems encountered in research are not linear; the relationship between motivation and errors is one example. Luckily, many relationships that are not linear may be expressed as linear relationships. We can detect these relationships with the PARTIAL option on the MODEL statement in PROC REG. I will show you how to interpret the plots produced, and demonstrate that curvilinear relationships are revealed in partial plots that cannot be detected in simple scattergrams. Finally, I will show you how to create transformed variables to represent the nonlinear terms, and the value of centering in creating Quadratic terms.",25p253.pdf
"Exact logistic regression has become an important analytical technique, especially in the pharmaceutical industry, since the usual asymptotic methods for analyzing small, skewed, or sparse data sets are unreliable. Inference based on enumerating the exact distributions of sufficient statistics for parameters of interest in a logistic regression model, conditional on the remaining parameters, is computationally infeasible for many problems. Hirji, Mehta, and Patel (1987) developed an efficient algorithm for generating the required conditional distributions, thus making these methods computationally available. This paper discusses the theory and methods for exact logistic regression and illustrates their application in Version 8 of the SAS R System with new facilities in the LOGISTIC procedure.",25p254.pdf
"PAPER 255-25 G ETTING S TARTED WITH PROC LOGISTIC Andrew H. Karp Sierra Information Services, Inc. USA Introduction Logistic Regression is an increasingly popular analytic tool. Used to predict the probability that the 'event of interest' will occur as a linear function of one (or more) continuous and/or dichotomous independent variables, this technique is implemented in the SAS ® System in PROC LOGISTIC. This paper gives an overview of how some common forms of logistic regression models can be implemented using PROC LOGISTIC as well as important changes and enhancements to the procedure in Releases 6.07 and above of the SAS ® System. Background Logistic regression is commonly used to obtain predicted probabilities that a unit of the population under analysis will acquire the event of interest as a linear function of one or more:  continuous-level variables  dichotomous (binary) variables  or, a combination of both continuous and binary independent variables. Many concepts in logistic regression will be familiar to people who already have experience with simple and multiple regression models. In fact, much of the syntax in PROC LOGISTIC will be familiar to SAS System users already experienced with using PROCs REG and/or GLM. In logistic regression, however, the dependent variable is dichotomous and is usually coded as:  zero (event did not occur)  one (event did occur) for each particular subject in the data set upon which the analysis will be carried out. The logistic function is used to estimate, as a function of unit changes in the independent variable, the probability that the event of interest will occur. This function is often called the link function in that it connects, or 'links' changes in values of the independent variables to increasing (or decreasing) probability of occurrence of the event being modeled by the dependent variable. Implementation in the SAS System Techniques for implementing logistic regression are found in PROC LOGISTIC in the STAT",25p255.pdf
"We propose to use two seemingly different R 2 measures of fit in PROC LOGISTIC and PROC GENMOD (SAS/STAT), and we show that they are closely related to each other in terms of the amount of information gained when including predictors, in comparison with the null model. We suggest working with these R 2 measures s imultaneously rather than separately because they can be seen as two faces of the same coin  information, and using them in parallel is similar to the binocular vision.

"Paper 257-25 A Methodology for Customer Segmentation Using Existing Product Category Schemes and The SAS® System Christopher S. Andrews, DiaLogos, Inc., Boston, MA Abstract: Nearly every retailer (or e-tailer) has a methodology for categorizing the products that they sell. However, most of them do not have a clearly defined system (or any system for that matter) for categorizing their customers by the types of products they buy. This is unfortunate since, in the rapidly evolving world of customer relationship management, this level of customer understanding is critical. This paper will develop a methodology for turning product categorization on its ear (so to speak) and into a customer segmentation scheme that is not only straightforward in its production, but also simple in its interpretation. In addition to the development of customer segments, this paper will also present methods for evaluating the performance of segments from a financial perspective. Enhanced targeting is a natural consequence of this, as well as similar evaluation techniques that will suggest themselves. The paper is designed to be soup-to-nuts covering everything from the data manipulation necessary to begin the analysis, all the way through to the financial calculations used to evaluate the segmentation performance. As such, the PROC SUMMARY and PROC SQL from BASE SAS will be prominently utilized, as will PROC FASTCLUS from SAS STAT. The Issue: In most retail marketing shops the focus is product centric. That is, customers get offers based on what they bought most recently, or sometimes what they bought only once. The problem with this type of marketing is that it is highly susceptible to unusual or seasonal purchases (such as gifts). In the brick and mortar world this can be annoying to customers who receive mail offers for products they have no interest in buying. In the ecommerce world, this can be devastating. Because of the relative ease with which customers can opt-out of all future e",25p257.pdf
"It is often desirable to adjust the weights ofa sample so that its marginal totals on specified characteristics agree with external control totals. Agreement is usually achieved iteratively, one variable at a time, by applying a proportional adjustment to the weights of the cases that belong to the same category of the variable. We developed a SAS macro for this operation (known as sample-balancing or raking), so that we would no longer have to export data from SAS and use a FORTRAN program that was originally designed to accept card input! The macro imposes no limit on the number of marginal variables or on the numbers of categories of those variables, and it allows the user to specify the tolerance for convergence. The paper reviews the algorithm and discusses experience with its use. 1.",25p258.pdf

"In a competitive, industrial environment it is imperative that products be brought to market with minimal expenditure of resources and maximal robustness. This may be accomplished with statistical consultation, but increasingly utilizes extensive input from the bench scientist. This paper delineates a simple, formalized approach that utilizes the simplicity and widespread use of JMP for exploratory analysis and initial identification of important factors. This is followed by a more detailed analysis in SAS which will characterize main effects and interactions, and assists in the elucidation of a final model that will most closely reflect physical reality. In the example discussed, a detailed model of an immunochemical interaction is developed from an initial screening design in JMP. The product, a reagent system for measurement of an HIV serotype, is developed in SAS from this initial analysis. Specifically, the roles of the main effects are reexamined and re-evaluated, the role of interaction is extensively probed, and a variance component analysis is performed. By utilizing the more powerful and flexible SAS PROC's such as  REG, STEPWISE, MIXED, and GLM, a final model is constructed that will supply the chemist and life scientist with an accurate reflection of the true physical process.",25p260.pdf
"Comparing the effectiveness of two treatments on nonrandomized groups is difficult because there are almost always baseline differences between the groups. Propensity scores (Rosenbaum and Rubin, Biometrika 1983) are a valuable but underutilized approach for adjusting for group differences. When two groups are being compared, the propensity score can be calculated as the predicted probability of group membership from a logistic regression. It represents the 'propensity' for an observation to be in one group or the other. By adjusting for the value of the propensity score in a linear model, one effectively adjusts for any group differences attributable to the variables used to create the propensity score. In addition, the values of the propensity scores can serve as a diagnostic tool to evaluate the comparability of the groups in a quantitative way.   In this paper, three practical examples are presented. In each example, propensity scores are used to adjust for differences between nonrandomized groups. Propensity scores were created using SAS System ® PROC LOGISTIC or PROC CATMOD. For two examples, a linear model estimated using PROC GLM was used to compare groups; in the third example, Poisson regression was performed using PROC GENMOD.

"Suppose that a response variable and its predictor variable are nonlinearly related but their relationship is linearizable through transformation, such as the log or square root transform on the response variable. In this situation, confidence intervals on the mean response at a given level of the predictor variable are traditionally done by first calculating the confidence bounds on the mean of the transformed response variable and then taking the inverse transform of these bounds. Although accurate for predication intervals, this ad hoc approach typically yields extremely biased intervals that do not produce the intended level of confidence for the mean response. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach using bootstrapped percentile intervals and bootstrap bias corrected intervals. This procedure will involve repeated application of the MACRO ""jackboot.sas"", provided by the SAS u institute, PROC REG, and DATA STEP programming. In addition to the theoretical development in this paper, we include a simulation study in which SAS is used to demonstrate that the bootstrapped intervals produce more accurate coverage. Also, we provide detailed instructions on how to use the ""jackboot.sas"" macro in these situations.

"SAS ® 's PROC X11 is based on the Census Bureau's X-11 seasonal adjustment program written in the early 1960's. Future SAS/ETS ® Versions will contain PROC X12, based on the Census Bureau's new X-12-ARIMA program, a publicly-available program used worldwide for time series modeling and seasonal adjustment. Major advances in X-12-ARIMA include 1) the ability to use regARIMA modelsregression models with ARIMA errors, 2) a new user interface, and 3) new modeling and seasonal adjustment diagnostics, including graphics. This paper will briefly review some of the basic issues of seasonal adjustment and advances in X-12-ARIMA over X-11. I will focus on the diagnostics available in X-12-ARIMA, particularly the graphical diagnostics including spectral graphs, forecast error history graphs, and revision graphs.

"Statistical power analysis characterizes the ability of a study to detect a meaningful effect sizefor example, the difference between two population means. It also determines the sample size required to provide a desired power for an effect of scientific interest. Proper planning reduces the use of designs that have little chance of producing significant results and determines the most sensitive design for the resources available. Power analysis is now integral to the health and behavioral sciences, and its use is steadily increasing wherever empirical studies are performed. SAS Institute is working to implement power analysis for common situations such as t-tests, ANOVA, comparison of binomial proportions, equivalence testing, survival analysis, contingency tables and linear models, and eventually for a wide range of models and designs.

"Multiple imputation provides a useful strategy for dealing with data sets with missing values. Instead of filling in a single value for each missing value, Rubins (1987) multiple imputation procedure replaces each missing value with a set of plausible values that represent the uncertainty about the right value to impute. These multiply imputed data sets are then analyzed by using standard procedures for complete data and combining the results from these analyses. No matter which complete-data analysis is used, the process of combining results from different imputed data sets is essentially the same. This results in valid statistical inferences that properly reflect the uncertainty due to missing values. This paper reviews methods for analyzing missing data, including basic concepts and applications of multiple imputation techniques. The paper also presents new SAS R procedures for creating multiple imputations for in- complete multivariate data and for analyzing results from multiply imputed data sets. These procedures are still under development and will be available in experimental form in Release 8.1 of the SAS System.",25p267.pdf

"is a valuable tool for investigating the behavior of spatial random variables. The new SIM2D procedure in SAS simulates normal spatial data with a variety of possible covariance structures. The simulations can be unconditional or conditional on the observed sample data. This general paper motivates spatial simulation, describes and illustrates the SIM2D procedure and also discusses its possible applications. 1. MOTIVATION Spatially referenced data comes in many forms and arises in many subject areas. Knowledge of the long-run behavior of the variable(s) can be very beneficial with respect to understanding the underlying process and the context of a recently obtained set of observations.  With a reasonable assumed model for the data, spatial simulation can give us valuable insight for the entire region which isnt possible through the limited spatial coverage of the sample. Consider the following example where we have phosphorous concentrations in a field with the values and locations as displayed below by PROC G3D. Were interested in knowing whether the observations imply that the phosphorous level for the entire field is high this year relative to past years. If it is indeed high, expensive fertilizer may not be uniformly applied as it is not required to produce the desired yield.

"The objective of this study is to analyze the differences between hospitalizations for two cohorts with incomplete data using Cox's proportional hazard modeling with right censoring. Utilizing the SAS procedure PROC PHREG, comparisons for specific hospitalizations and broad categories of hospitalizations were achieved for two cohorts over the time period of August 1, 1991 through September 30, 1995. An individual contributed to the Cox proportional hazards model until time of event, or until censoring at time of withdrawal or termination of study. The baseline option in PROC PHREG was used to create and output the survival estimates, which are a function of the probability estimates over time. Cox modeling showed no increased risk for hospitalization among subjects exposed to environmental contaminants when compared to those not exposed. The SAS system's PROC PHREG with baseline option was instrumental in dealing with attrition of subjects over the study period and producing probability of hospitalization curves as a function of time.",25p272.pdf
"The use of kernel density estimation to develop instrument panels will be demonstrated in the continuous monitoring of medical outcomes. Kernel density functions can be quickly derived using SAS/QC®, and can be used to examine conditional probabilities. In version 7, SAS/STAT® contains PROC KDE that can also be used to estimate the kernel density. Specifically, kernel density functions were used to determine whether a new protocol was being implemented properly and whether the intervention had impact upon the patients it was intended to serve. The purpose of this protocol was to systematically monitor and control glucose levels in diabetic patients undergoing open heart surgery. The motivation for the protocol was to reduce infection rates, and average length of stay. Kernel density was used to determine the distributions of glucose levels, and to determine whether protocol interventions at high patient glucose levels resulted in a subsequent reduction. After analysis, it was concluded that the protocol was being properly implemented and that glucose levels were more likely to decrease once they climbed above 150 mg/dL. Initial results also indicated a reduction in the infection rate for diabetic patients.",25p273.pdf
"This paper explores the use of the optimisation procedures in SAS/OR software with application to the decision system support using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques. Data Envelopment Analysis is a linear programming method for assessing the efficiency and productivity of Decision Making Units. Over the last decade DEA has gained considerable attention as a managerial tool for measuring performance of organisations and it has been used widely for assessing the efficiency of public and private sectors such as banks, airlines, hospitals, universities and manufactures. As a result, new applications with more variables and more complicated models are being introduced. On the other hand, the SAS u System has numerous optimisation routines that handle the standard optimisation problems such as linear programming with all types of constraints. To facilitate the use of DEA by SAS users, a SAS/DEA code was implemented in the SAS programming language. The SAS macro developed in this paper selects the chosen variables from a SAS data file and constructs a Linearprogramming model based on the selected DEA.

"In toxicology, it is often of interest to perform a Dunnetts test to determine whether a pesticide or toxic substance is different at various levels from a control. The problem is complicated by the fact that often a traditional analysis of variance (ANOVA) model cannot be used because of a complex variance structure. For example, it might be of interest to determine whether rats receiving different doses of a toxic substance are statistically different with respect to certain outcome measures from a control. Because of concerns that animals from the same litter might be correlated, generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods are often used in modeling these types of data. In SAS, PROC GENMOD allows GEE fitting but does not provide p-values for multiple comparisons with a control. In this paper, we discuss how the algorithm proposed by Hsu (1992) for performing the Dunnetts test and implemented in PROC GLM in the LSMEANS statement can be extended to GEE models.

"l, SAS Institute Inc. Cary, NC ABSTRACT The analysis of most designed experiments and observational studies require mixed models. Version 4.0 of JMP Software has greatly expanded its capabilities for analyzing mixed models by including restricted maximum likelihood (REML) methods. This paper will demonstrate the process of analyzing several mixed models using the 4.0 version of JMP. Models examined include randomized complete block designs, incomplete block designs, split plot designs, strip plot designs, and designs with random covariates, where examples are drawn from engineering, medicine and agriculture. Version 4.0 of JMP can fit many of the standard mixed models and the analysis provides estimation of the variance components, estimates of the fixed effect parameters, tests of hypothesis about the fixed effects parameters, appropriate estimated standard errors, confidence intervals about variance components using REML, and least squares means and comparisons. The functionality of JMP is contrasted with that of PROC MIXED of the SAS® System. The mixed model capability of JMP provides the data analyst with the tools to enable appropriate analysis of many mixed models. This presentation is geared toward the practicing statistician.

"Polynomial Gompertz growth model, that models the logarithm of the relative growth rate with a polynomial, provides a good fit to individual growth curves and growth percentiles. Since the expression of a Polynomial Gompertz growth function contains an integral, this nonlinear model cannot be fitted by SAS Procedure NLIN. At present this model can be fitted to growth data by advanced nonlinear optimization subroutines within SAS/IML u .  This paper describes a macro that uses NLPLM subroutine to fit a Polynomial Gompertz model. The macro also calculates the estimates of important growth characteristics such as final adult height (using QUAD call for numerical integration) and peak growth velocity, age at peak growth velocity, age and height at adolescent growth spurt takeoff etc. (using SAS/IML NLPNRR subroutine). Good initial estimates are essential for convergence and are calculated by approximating the relative growth rate (in given examples, through SAS/IML SPLINEC and SPLINEV calls) and fitting its logarithm with the polynomial of degree K. The macro outputs the values of predicted growth curve, velocity curve, relative growth rate curve and residuals ready to be plotted with SAS/GRAPH u .

"In clinical trials response variables are measured at different times and doses. This paper explores methods to determine the dose that optimizes the response based on multiple responses and doses. Linear dose-response modeling can be performed using repeated measures analysis (using PROC MIXED) for change in response (Y) using dose (X) as a continuous explanatory variable with time, dose, and time-by-dose interaction as fixed effects. The error structure to model the correlation between the repeated measures needs to be determined e.g. using the Akaike information criteria. To compare the responses at each dose, additional analyses using dose as a classification variable can be performed and pairwise comparisons can be obtained. Non-linear dose response modeling can be performed using continuous dose, X (using PROC NLIN) with the following model: Percent change in Y= b 0 + (X . b 1 )/(X + b 2 ) + error, where b 0 is the response at dose = 0 , b 1 is the optimum % change in Y compared to dose = 0 and b 2 is the dose at 50% of b 1 . A fixed value of can be chosen based on minimum residual sum of squares. Predicted values are calculated and plotted against the observed % change in Y for all doses.

"ashington, DC Abstract Optimizing SAS software from the perspective of an applications programmer requires writing efficient and clever code. However, here I'll re-examine my computer system with a systems administrator's eye. I'll be more concerned with the speed and the efficiency of the hardware and the operating system, Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, as it runs SAS software. Optimization is making the computer system run faster by minimizing bottlenecks. Running SAS software to manipulate large data sets and to crunch vast amounts of numbers puts a significant load on a computer. Any system improvements would produce faster query and report turn-around, creating a more efficient office.

The same is true for Lotus SmartSuite member applications. Thus, any Ole DB compliant consumer (such as Microsoft Excel, Lotus 1-2-3, Knosys ProClarity, and many others) will be able to directly query a SAS MDDB file using Ole DB on all major platforms, including Windows NT, UNIX, and mainframes. This paper will provide an introduction to Ole DB.  It will describe Ole DB and how it works. It will discuss the components of Ole DB and how to Register data. The SAS implementation of Ole DB will be demonstrated, along with other Ole DB consumers such as Microsoft Excel and Lotus 1-2-3.   The paper is intended as a beginning paper for the advanced user. AUTHOR S NOTE Because this paper includes information concerning several currently evolving technologies from SAS Institute, and also describes the results of several ongoing projects, the final version was not available for inclusion in the Confe",25p284.pdf

"So many application changes but so little time. This paper will address the problem of distributing software to users across the hall or across the country. As companies become more departmentalized, the red tape involved in adding or updating an application grows exponentially. Just as too many cooks can spoil the soup, dealing with multiple server administrators and installation personnel can cause major synchronization problems. By automating the software distribution process, the user can have the latest and greatest software with a transparent update process. The techniques discussed in this paper utilize current day technology rather than vaporware.",25p286.pdf
"nage your PC SAS Software System so that upgrades, add-ins, free software, and other such goodies are easily and rapidly distributed to everyone who uses SAS. PC SAS Users will get the most out of this paper, but everyone can learn something new. INTRODUCTION Managing multiple users of the SAS Software System on a PC Network can be a headache. Some sites have as many as 500 (and some have even many more!) installations of PC SAS. This paper shows you how to begin effectively managing an extensive system of PC SAS. This system assumes the following: You are operating in a PC SAS environment Each SAS programmer has read-write access to one unique network drive SAS is installed locally on each users PC THE SECRET: AUTOEXEC.SAS The AUTOEXEC.SAS file is a SAS program that runs when each new SAS session is started. Using this utility, you can then have the SAS supervisor check for and install any required updates and maintenance automatically. THE LOCAL USERS OPTIONS A DO NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES BELOW THIS LINE comment should be included, and all administrative statements should be entered after that comment. This way, the user can use the AUTOEXEC.SAS without modifying the administrative capabilities. CREATING THE SASUSER TAG Each SAS User needs to have a unique identifier of some type. The easiest way to do this is to create a macro variable &SASUSER using a %LET statement in the AUTOEXEC.SAS. %let sasuser = PMCDONALD ; This username must be unique among all SAS users on the sys",25p287.pdf
"Programmers have developed a variety of communication methods for disseminating information programmatically to a person or group of people. From the early form-letter days using PROC FSLETTER to current methods of personalized e-mail and Internet based communications, we have sought to create relevant content for timely information. In this paper, we will explore three different categories of messaging: store and forward, publish and subscribe and remote procedure calls. Each of these will be presented along with methods for constructing and implementing the message-based procedures in SAS.",25p288.pdf
"Data warehouse applications thrive on pre-summarized data. When a warehouse's data originates on a mainframe computer, it makes sense to take advantage of the mainframe's power to summarize the data before porting it to the warehouse server. The SAS System is the perfect tool to use to summarize data bound for a data warehouse. However, summarizing very large SAS data sets with many CLASS variables can be problematic even on a mainframe computer. This paper introduces the concept of Horizontal Summarization. Horizontal Summarization is a methodology that can be employed to summarize very large SAS data sets by every combination of a specific set of CLASS variables. Horizontal Summarization is designed to work with the mainframe operating system and avoid common out-of-memory and work-spaceshortage abends. Horizontal Summarization was specifically developed and employed as the front-end summarization tool for a data warehouse application.",25p290.pdf
"Have you ever had trouble getting a SAS job to complete, although your SAS code is bug free? Often, especially when processing large amounts of data, your operating environment just does not have enough resources to complete your SAS job the way you have written it. Likely, a solution to the resource problems you have or might encounter exists. Herein, the author will share some of his favorite tricks to squeeze more out of the operating environment and for working SAS code around resource limitations. These tricks will include SAS code, SAS options, and operating system parameters. This paper will cover subjects such as reducing the number of SAS data sets needed, reducing the size of SAS data sets, sorting efficiencies, optimizing data library parameters, and cleaning up the work environment.",25p291.pdf

"t months, Hewlett-Packard and SAS Institute have jointly embarked on performance tuning and optimization techniques addressing real customer needs in large-scale data warehousing environments. This paper describes the scalability of the SAS Scalable Performance Data Server ® software on HP-UX and illustrates the performance improvements available when running the HP-UX 11 64-bit operating system. It focuses on resource utilization, system architecture, new Scalable Performance Data Server 64-bit enhancements, and the results to meet and exceed the requirements for a large telecommunications customer, Mannesmann Arcor. Two configurations of SAS Scalable Performance Data Server on HP-UX systems are described, and some hints for optimizing this application on HP-UX are offered. The Problem Mannesmann Arcor, a European tele- communications company with some 4,000 employees, had a problem: Too many existing and potential customers were being lured away by competitive offerings. Mannesmann Arcors managers had a full suite of products and a data warehouse that held a large amount of customer data. However, the data, although extensive, lacked the granularity and precision that would allow Mannesmann Arcor to tailor services for particular customers and to match customers and products precisely. Mannesmann Arcor also expected business growth, which would cause the data volume to grow in a linear manner. Mannesmann Arcors Original Database The database itself was structured using st",25p293.pdf
"sent tips and techniques for getting the best performance out of the SAS System on the UNIX operating systems.   We will address changes that can be made to the SAS System as well as operating system parameters. INTRODUCTION Everyone wants the best performance that they can get with the least effort. We will explore some techniques that can be used to get better performance from SAS programs without changing the SAS source code. WHAT IS PERFORMANCE? Performance and performance problems boil down to three resources: CPU, Memory, and I/O. A lack in anyone of these can make any of the others look like the problem. For example: You have users complaining about slow interactive and shell performance. So you do some quick checking and you see that disk I/O is high and that a particular large batch job that you know does a lot of I/O is running. So you make the assumption that the I/O bound job is the culprit and tell your users to hang on for a little while until the job finishes. But, the job finishes and the problem does not go away. After a little further investigation you see that the I/O problem still exists but, it is actually due to paging and swapping, which indicates a memory problem not an I/O one. The real key to solving performance issues is knowing what your system looks like when it is healthy. This allows them to observe trends and to catch problems before they become severe enough to affect productivity. CPU The CPU determines how much work can be done by a machine",25p294.pdf
